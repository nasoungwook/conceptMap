['hi i m dr shini somara and i hear you want to learn physics i have to say good choice physics is the science of how the world -- really the whole universe -- works and i don t know if you ve noticed but in the world i live in things tend to move around a lot so that s what we re going to study first the science of motion and it turns out to be incredibly useful -- for figuring out things like where you are orwhere you ve been or how you re moving through the world why is that worth knowing well for one thing the police use physics to decide how exactly how fast you re movingthrough the world and if that motion happens to break the law so if you re gonna understand how and why you got that ticket they gave you -- and maybeeven know enough to dispute it -- you have to know the science of motion too and in order to do that you ll need to understand a few essential conditions thatdescribe your physical place in the universe conditions like time position velocity and acceleration so to talk about all of these things at the same time you ll need a set of equations that links all of them together these are called the kinematic equations so for the next few minutes let s talk about how you can figure out your place inthe world -- literally -- which just might help you beat that speeding ticket theme music let s say you re driving on a straight stretch of highway say someplace nice and flat on the wide open spaces of the northern plains of the united states say north dakota you come across a red light and even though there are no cars in sight you stop because you re a good driver who obeys traffic laws then the light turns green so you hit the gas annnnd exactly seven seconds later you hear the sirens and see the flashing lights of a police car you re promptly served with a ticket for speeding in a kilometer an hour zone but wait were you really going that fast did you actually break the law you can t really tell because the speedometer in your car is broken so you need to find another way to figure out how fast you were going and decide ifyou want to take this up this issue with johnny law in court that s where physics comes in -- the physics of moving in a straight line let s start by talking about how your car was moving driving along a straight highway is an example of one-dimensional motion because the carcan only move back and forth along that line that s different from something that s free to move in all three dimensions like a boomerang flying through the air and instead of describing that motion just in terms of speed or direction like a policeofficer or other non-physicist might do we physicists describe it with math maths that measures the four main conditions of the car s movement --its time position velocity and acceleration time simply tells you how long you were driving for position is also important it lets youknow where you are or where you were it can even be negative for one-dimensional motion there are only two directions you can move in --in this case forward or backward east or west so if the change in position -- known as displacement -- is positive you ll knowyou ve moved in one of those directions if it s negative you re traveling the other way but which direction is positive and which is negative that s totally arbitrary you could decide that east should be positive and west negative or the other way around-- but the answers you get will mean the same thing you just have to make sure to keep track of which direction is positive and keep thatin mind when you re talking about velocity and acceleration too velocity is the way your position changes over time and it s also a pretty big deal it s kind of like speed but just like with displacement it also tells you which directionyou re moving in based on whether it s positive or negative now what about when your velocity changes that s the fourth quality of movement you ll want to pay attention to acceleration if you ve ever been in a car when someone slammed on the gas that feeling of beingpressed back against your seat is acceleration -- your velocity s changing so how do we plot out all of these different conditions that describe the movement of youand your vehicle through the plains of north dakota a non-physicist might visualize this movement on something like a map but for us graphsare the most useful way to show how all this change in position is happening graphs are generally presented as position versus time -- with position on the verticalaxis and time on the horizontal axis we ll label your position as x and time as t now let s imagine three different scenarios for how you drove through this small town and graph each one first let s say that after you went through the red light you just stayed in one spot-- say at meters from the light -- for three seconds from that moment the graph of your position would just be a flat line at x m like this now what if you didn t stop but instead were coasting at one meter per second then the line would be diagonal to show how your position was changing -- like this and the third time let s say you were standing still at first at the meter mark but then you hit the gas and you moved in such a way that after second you went meter in the positivedirection and after seconds you went meters and after seconds you ve gone meters in that case you end up with a graph that s all curvy like this but there s more going on in these scenarios than just your position and time you also have to be able to graph your velocity and acceleration so to graph your velocity you d put your velocity on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis and you ll note that since velocity is measured as the change in position over time it s measured in meters per second the graph for acceleration is quite similar -- acceleration a goes on the vertical and time goes on the horizontal and since acceleration is measured as the change in meters per second its units aremeters per second per second -- otherwise known as meters per second squared so time position velocity and acceleration all relate to each other velocity is the change in position over time and acceleration is the change in velocity over time and often your velocity will be different from moment to moment -- like the third timeyou drove down the highway when you hit the gas but let s say you wanted to know your average velocity for a certain period -- say for those first three seconds all you have to do is take the change in position and divide it by the change in time figuring out how much something is changing just means that you have to subtract its starting value from its final value and since as physicists we ll end up doing that a lot we abbreviate that differenceusing the lowercase greek letter delta so we can use that to write the equation for average velocity it s just delta x over delta t the change in position over the change in time now what about the third scenario when you had your foot on the gas and kept accelerating you started out at the meter mark and ended up at the meter mark so your change inposition or delta-x would be minus or meters and you started at seconds and ended at seconds meaning that your delta-t was seconds over seconds you moved meters that s meters per second the equation we use to describe average acceleration is a lot like the one for average velocity because it s just the change in velocity divided by the change in time so in that case your equation would be delta v over delta t and here s something that is incredibly handy since we re talking about constant acceleration that is acceleration that takes placeat a constant rate we can rearrange this equation to get v v at that s average velocity equaling to velocity at time plus the product of acceleration times time this my fellow physicists is an equation we ll be using a lot we call it the definition of acceleration -- because that s exactly what it is it s saying that constant acceleration is equal to the change in velocity divided by the change in time --we just used algebra to move the variables around now it s worth noting that there are lots of different kinds of acceleration ones that don t involve speeding tickets -- like when something is falling the force of gravity pulling it down is making it accelerate at meters per second squared which physicists often abbreviate as a lowercase g so we ll just call that constant small g there s a capital g that s going to come up later so the definition of acceleration is the first of the two main kinematic equationsthat we ll be using but it only links velocity acceleration and time what about position there s an equation for that too -- the second kinematic equation which we ll callthe displacement curve because it takes your acceleration your starting velocity andhow long you were moving for and uses that information to figure out what your displacement was and the displacement curve equation looks like this it makes sense if you think about it -- if your acceleration is the change in your velocity and your velocity is the change in your position then there should be some way to link all of them together now there are lots of other kinematic equations too like these but you only really need to know the first two -- the definition of acceleration andthe displacement curve the others are just different ways of rearranging these main two and because these two equations have so many terms in common you can use them together really easily for example if you know your acceleration and your starting and final velocities you could use the definition of acceleration to figure out how much time you were traveling for then you could plug that value for time into the displacement curve equation and use it to find your displacement now that we know what the kinematic equations are we can finally use the power of physicsto find out whether you were speeding when the cops pulled you over as with most physics problems the first thing we need to do is write down everything we know in this case we know your initial velocity v-nought was and your time t was seconds the first thing we need to find is your acceleration which we can get using the displacement curve plugging in everything we know we find that your acceleration a was meters per second squared then we can plug all of that into the definition of acceleration to find your final velocity like this we learn that you were going meters per second when the cops pulled you over that s kilometers an hour so you definitely deserve that ticket sorry but in this very first episode of crash course physics you learned all about position velocity and acceleration we also talked about the two main kinematic equations the definition of acceleration and the displacement curve crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head overto their channel to check out amazing shows like deep look the good stuff and pbs space time this episode of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our graphics team is thought cafe ', 'every discipline of science has its very own special language --the way it communicates the ideas that it investigates for example biology finds order in the world by giving every living thing a name in latin chemistry has a system of prefixes suffixes and numerals to tell you in a word or two the exact composition of an atom or a compound but physics has to communicate its ideas differently the language of physics is mathematics because if you re trying to describe how the world works you really have to know howthings relate to each other in a mathematical way for example we ve been talking a lot about position velocity and acceleration and how they re all connected velocity is a measure of your change in position and acceleration is a measure of your change in velocity they re connected -- one quality will describe how the other is changing and the way we describe change in mathematics is through calculus calculus explains how and why things change using derivatives which help you determine how an equation is changing as well as with integrals which you can use to calculate the area under a curve derivatives and integrals themselves are closely connected but let s start with derivatives you probably won t be able to go straight from this lesson to your calculus final but hopefully in about minutes you will be able to understand some of the maths thatscientists have been using to think about physics for the last years or so and you ll also have a new way to fight speeding tickets you know just in case theme music last time we talked about that unfortunate incident where you got a speeding ticket your speedometer was broken but because we knew your acceleration we were able to calculatehow fast you were going when the cops pulled you over so now let s talk about what happens next say the police drive off you re ready to get back on the road so you hit the gas andzoom forward moving faster and faster but in this scenario we don t know your acceleration we only know how much your position is changing over time in this instance your position happens to be equal to the amount of time you vebeen driving squared so we d write that as the equation x t seconds in you pass a detector with a sign that tells you your speed you keep driving foot still on the gas before you realize what number you saw on the sign and oh no you just got a speeding ticket in the last episode for doing kmh in a kmh zone and now the sign says you re going even faster now you want to know if the number on the detector is accurate -- in other words you wantto find your velocity at the exact moment you passed it that velocity is just a measure of your change in position -- its derivative so to find your velocity we ll need to find the derivative of your position and in order to determine that we first need to talk about limits not speed limits -- i mean the derivatives kind pause i ll explain limits are based on the idea that if you have a an equation on a graph you can often predictwhat it s going to look like at one point just by knowing what it looks like at the surrounding points for example let s say you have a graph of x t -- from our speeding scenario aboveand you want to find out how your position is changing at the exact moment that time is equal to zero that s what we d call the limit as t approaches zero so you take a look at what s happening around t at t x is at t x is and at t x is you can probably tell that as we get closer and closer to t your value of x is gettingcloser to zero too that s what mathematicians mean when they talk about a limit limits are useful because they can help predict what happens as you make intervals smaller an interval is just a range on a graph it s the space between two points on the horizontal axis so the first thing we can try is calculating your average velocity over the interval from to seconds to do that we use an equation that we talkedabout last time -- your average velocity which is equal to thechange in your position -- divided by the change in time that turns out to be ms problem is it s still just an average -- it s not exactly how fast you were going after seconds of acceleration when you passed the detector because of limits we know that you could get a little closer to the right number bycalculating your average over smaller and smaller intervals then you d see that thenumber seemed to be getting closer and closer to meters per second which means that you re going to need to slow wayyyy down if you don t want to getyour second speeding ticket of the day but that s the idea of derivatives you can use infinitely tiny intervals to figure outexactly how an equation is changing at any moment you can even come up with an equation to describe the change that s exactly what velocity is-- an equation that describes change in position and acceleration describes change in velocity so we d call velocity the derivative of position and acceleration the derivative of velocity now when it comes to how you can express a derivative in writing mathematicians havecome up with shortcuts like what s known as the power rule as the name suggests it s used for equations with variables raised to powers or exponents-- as long as the exponent is a number for example x t would work with the power rule because t is raised to the power of the power rule says that for these kinds of equations to calculate the derivative allyou need is one weird trick take the number of that exponent -- in this case two -- and stick it in front of thevariable then you subtract from the exponent and that s your derivative so the derivative of x t is just t which means that no matter how many seconds you vehad your foot on the gas your velocity will be t -- so double the number of seconds after seconds you were going a modest ms but after seconds you were going afull ms which is not good we d write that like this where dxdt is just a way ofsaying that we re taking the derivative of the part of the equation that involves t or as a mathematician would put it we re taking the derivative of x with respect to t you ll also sometimes see this written in a different way if f of t is equal to t squared then f prime of t is equal to two t now let s try to find a couple more derivatives using the power rule x t is another power-style equation it has a variable t raised to a power with a number in front of it the first thing we do is take the exponent and stickit in front of the variable but there s already a number in front of t so we end up multiplying them times is then we subtract from the power that t is raised to so we end up with t same goes for equations where the exponents are fractions or decimals so the derivativeof t is half t to the negative one half it works for negative exponents too -- the derivative of t - is just negative t tothe negative third now there are a few more equations whose derivatives you should understand trigonometry -- which we use to calculate the angles and sides of triangles -- is goingto come up a lot in physics because we ll be using right angle triangles all the time so it s a good idea to know how to find the derivatives of sin x and cos x sine tells you that if you have a right angle triangle and x is an angle in that triangle then sin x will be the length of the side opposite that angle divided by the hypotenuse cosine does the same thing just with the side next to the angle divided by the hypotenuse so their graphs tell you what those ratios will be depending on the angle we can actually try to guess the derivative of sin x just by looking at its graph you can see that the curve has turning points every so often at x - degrees x degrees and so on -- repeating every degrees meaning at those points the equations aren t changing at all -- so the derivative at theseturning points is also going to be exactly zero let s pull up another graph where we ll plot the derivative and put little dots wherewe know it ll be zero now what s happening between those turning points well from - to - degrees sin x is decreasing in other words its change -- and therefore its derivative -- must be negative then from - to degrees sin x is increasing -- so it ll have a positive derivative and so on there are actually a lot more clues in this graph to help us find the derivative butwe already know enough to make a decent guess if we smoothly connect the dots on the graph of our derivative keeping in mind where thecurve should be positive and where it should be negative hey this derivative is lookinga whole lot like the graph of cos x that s because it is the derivative of sine is just cosine and that is going tocome up a lot so will these which you can work out on your own by repeating what we just did with thegraphs of sin x and cos x another important derivative that comes up a lot is a very special case and that se x the derivative of e x is just e x yep that s it no matter what in fact that s one way to define e which is kind of like pi in the sense that it sa simple letter representing a very specific irrational number -- about but withmore digits after the decimal point that go on forever it has all sorts of uses in calculus but it also shows up when you re studying thingslike finance and probability armed with all these ways to find derivatives you could take pretty much any equation ofyour position and calculate its derivative -- and therefore your velocity in the same way you could take the derivative of your velocity and find your acceleration but there s still a whole other part of calculus that we haven t talked about yet -- integrals-- which will let you do this backwards with integrals you can use your acceleration to find your velocity and your velocity to find your position but we ll save that for next time today you learned about limits and that derivatives use them to describe how an equation is changing we also talked about a few different kinds of derivatives powers constants trigonometry and e x crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head overto their channel to check out amazing shows like deep look the good stuff and pbs space time this episode of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our graphics team is thought cafe ', 'if you watched our last episode -- and really if you haven t you should you now know all about derivatives and how to use them to describe the way an equation is changing which means that now we can talk about the other main part of calculus -- basically the inverse of derivatives called integrals integrals are useful because they also tell you a lot about an equation if you plottedan equation on a graph the integral is equal to the area between the curve and the horizontal axis finding an integral is a little less straightforward than finding a derivative but as with derivatives there are shortcuts we can use to make things a little easier we ll even be able to use integrals to talk about how things move -- specifically theequation we ve been calling the displacement curve and why it looks the way it does so let s get started theme music say you want to know how high your bedroom window is above the ground outside below but you don t have anything to measure it with --just a ball the stopwatch app on your phone and your impressive knowledge of physics the force of gravity is what makes the ball fall so you know that its acceleration is small g ms downward but you re trying to find its change in position -- how far it falls we ve spent a lot of time talking about the connection between the qualities of motion position velocity and acceleration but so far we ve been describing that connection in a particular direction velocity is the derivative of position-- that is a measure of its change -- and acceleration is the derivative of velocity to figure out how far the ball falls you need to use the reverse of that connection expressed mathematically that means that velocity is the integral of acceleration and position is the integral of velocity in other words if you draw these equation on a graph velocity is equal to the areaunder the acceleration curve and position is equal to the area under the velocity curve finding that area is the tricky part there are simple ways to find the area of pretty much any shape as long as that shapeis made of nothing but straight lines and corners and when you think about it a curve is just a set of infinitely tiny lines so the area under a curve can be divided into a set of infinitely tiny rectangles integrals tell you what happens when you divide the area under a curve into those infinitelytiny rectangles take the area of each of them and add up those areas so how do you find that integral well you start by using the fact that integrals are basically the opposite of derivatives if you know that your velocity is equal to twice time for example then you know that s the derivative of the position so to find the equation for your position you just have to look for an equation whose derivative is t like x t for example it s kind of a roundabout way of doing things compared to the neat equation we were able to use to find derivatives but there is no tidy equation that we can use to calculate any integral we want but as with derivatives there are shortcuts for finding certain useful ones for instance you can take the power rule that we used for derivatives and run it backward basically you add one to the exponent then divide the variable by that number so the integral of t -- which is written like this -- becomes t in the same way the integral of t is t you can take the trigonometric derivatives that we talked about and do those backward too the integral of cos x is sin x and so on and the integral of e x is just e x but there s one complication that we haven t talked about yet -- maybe you ve already spotted it constants a constant is basically just a number it can literally be a number -- like or a half or negative or it can be a placeholder for a number like the small g we ve been using to represent the acceleration caused by gravity and constants pose a problem when it comes to integrals because the derivative of a constant is just a derivative is a rate of change after all so a constant which by definition doesn tchange will always have a derivative of zero which means that lots of different equations - an infinite number in fact - can all have the same derivative like the derivative of t is t but you can add any number -- or a letter representinga number -- to it and the derivative will still be t so the derivative of t is also t and the same is true for t - which means if you re looking for the intergral of an equation like x t you have infinitechoices all of which are equally correct t would work but so would t or t - or t in these cases we might know what the shape of the integral should look like on a graph-- like whether it s a straight line or how it curves -- but we don t know where to put it along the vertical axis so we need to know what the constant is in order to know where to start drawing its integral whatever the constant is equal to that s where the curve will intersect with the vertical axis so t would intersect at but t - would intersect at - you get the idea mathematicians had to figure out how to get around the problem of having infinite integralsto choose from so they came up with a way to represent all of them just add a c at the end of the integral that c stands for all of the constants that we know we could put there so if we say that the integral of t is t c then we re including t and t - and all those other infinite options --every equation whose derivative is t but sometimes you don t need the c at all because you can figure out where your integralis supposed to be on the y axis like if you have what s known as the initial value in the case of a position graph for instance the initial value would be where you started out so you d know to draw the rest of the graph s shape from there if you started at the meter mark say and moved one meter every second you d putthe graph here but if you started at the meter mark you d shift it up a little basically it gives you the point where your integral intersects the vertical axis -- which is the value of c let s try it and at the same time we might as well figure out the height of your bedroom window you re standing in your room holding a tennis ball out the window with your arm resting on the sill now you drop the ball and start your stopwatch app at the same time turns out that the ball takes seconds to hit the ground like we said earlier we know the ball s acceleration -- ms -- and we know the time involved somehow we have to get from there to the equation for the ball s position so first let s find its velocity -- the middle step -- by taking the integral of its acceleration take a look at this graph of the ball s acceleration over time it s just a flat line which means that it should be pretty easy to find the area between it and the horizontal axis it s a rectangle and the area of a rectangle is just its base times its height in this case the base is t the amount of time the ball took to fall and the height is a the acceleration so the area between the acceleration graph and the horizontal axis is just a times t and the integral is a times t plus that constant we add -- c for now we need the c because we know the general shape of the velocity graph it s a diagonal line slanted in such a way that every second it rises by an amount equal to the acceleration but still we don t know where to put that line on the vertical axis not yet anyway now we could have figured out the integral of acceleration just as easily by using the power rule the acceleration a is a constant but we could also say that it s a x t --because anything raised to the power is just so according to the power rule the integral of acceleration -- which is the velocity -- wouldbe equal to the acceleration multiplied by time plus c that s the same answer we got earlier now here s where the initial value comes in the velocity graph tells you what thevelocity is for each moment in time but we had to add the c because we didn t knowwhere to place it on the vertical axis -- when time equals zero so the integral of the acceleration could have just been acceleration x time or a t but it could also have been at or at - so we put a c in the integral instead to represent all those options but we can get rid of that c if we can figure out the velocity when time equals zero --what we ve been calling v and if we write our equation with that v in it as a placeholder for the velocity whentime equals zero we end up with the the full equation for velocity that should look familiar because it s one of our kinematic equations -- the definition of acceleration neat how everything works out like that this equation tells us that the final velocity of our falling tennis ball when it hit theground was ms downward but we aren t done yet we re looking to link acceleration and position so we ll need to go one step further by integrating again there are a couple of different ways we could do it but let s just use the power rule again the integral of a t is half a t squared and the integral of v is just v t put em together and you end up with this which is starting to look a whole lot likeanother kinematic equation -- the one we ve been calling the displacement curve now what about that c well just like before with the starting velocity the starting position will tell us where tostick this equation on the vertical axis so we ll just make c equal to the startingposition which we ll write as x and that s our integral -- the displacement curve equation which means that now we have everything we need to figure out how high your window is the starting velocity is zero because you just dropped the ball without throwing it the acceleration is ms and it took seconds to land and now you know everything there is to know about calculus long pause no you don t as you can probably imagine we ve barely scratched the surface here -- there s areason it normally takes two semesters of university just to cover the basics and you know some people spend their whole lives studying this stuff but we ve at least established enough background that when those things do come up in thiscourse we ll be able to use what we ve covered here to talk about them today you learned that integrals are the area between an equation on a graph and the horizontal axis you also learned a few shortcuts to help find them and how to find c using an initial value crash course philosophy is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head overto their channel to check out amazing shows like shanks fx gross science and pbs game show this episode of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'so far we ve spent a lot of time predicting movement where things are where they regoing and how quickly they re gonna get there but there s something missing -- something that has a lot to do with harry styles and today we re gonna address that we ve been talking about what happens when you do things like throw balls up in the airor drive a car down a straight road that kind of motion is pretty simple because there s only one axis involved the car s accelerating either forward or backward the ball s moving up or down there s no messysecond dimension to contend with but this is physics we may simplify calculations a lot of the time but we still want to describethe real world as best we can and in real life when you need more than one direction you turn to vectors theme music let s say we have a pitching machine like you d use for baseball practice we re going to be using it a lot in this episode so we might as well get familiar with how it works we can feed the machine a bunch of baseballs and have it spit them out at any speed we want up to m s the pitching height is adjustable and we can rotate it vertically so the ball can be launched at any angle it also has a random setting where the machine picks the speed height or angle of the ball all on its own suddenly we have way more options than just throwing a ball straight up in the air and now the ball can have both horizontal and vertical qualities at the same time before - we were able to use the constant acceleration equations to describe verticalor horizontal motion -- but we never used it for both at once and we re not going to do that today either instead we re going to split the ball s motion into two parts -- we ll talk about what shappening horizontally and vertically but completely separately and we ll do that with the help of vectors vectors are kind-of-like ordinary numbers -- which are also known as scalars -- becausethey have a magnitude which tells you how big they are but they have another characteristic too direction previously we might have said that a ball s velocity was meters per second and -- assumingwe d picked downward to be the positive direction -- we d know that the ball wasfalling down since its velocity was positive in other words we were taking direction into account but we could only describe thatdirection using a positive or a negative so we were limited to two directions along one axis but vectors change all that now - instead of just two directions we can talk about any direction it might help to think of a vector like an arrow on a treasure map you could draw anarrow that represents kilometers on the map -- that length would be the vector s magnitude but you need to point it in a particular direction to tell people where to find the treasure which is actually pretty much how physicists graph vectors you take your two usual axes aim in the vector s direction and then draw an arrow as long as its magnitude like say your pitching machine launches a ball at a degree angle from the horizontal with a starting velocity of meters per second we can just draw that as a vector with a magnitude of and a direction of degrees and let s say your catcher didn t catch the ball properly and dropped it then just before it hits the ground its velocity might ve had a magnitude of m s and adirection of degrees which we can draw like this that s why vectors are so useful you can describe any direction you want but there s a problem one you might have already noticed you can t just add or multiplythese vectors the same way you would ordinary numbers because they aren t ordinary numbers to do that we have to describe vectors differently when you draw a vector it s a lot like the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle the vector s magnitude tells you the length of that hypotenuse and you can use its angleto draw the rest of the triangle right angle triangles are cool like that you only need to know a couple of things about one like the length of a side and the degrees in an angle to draw the rest of it it s all just trigonometry connecting sides and angles through sines and cosines which is why you can also describe a vector just by writing the lengths of those two other sides in fact those sides are so good at describing a vector that physicists call them its components so let s go back to our pitching machine example for a minute we said that the vectorfor the ball s starting velocity had a magnitude of and a direction of degrees above the horizontal we can draw that out like this that s all we need to do the trig the length of that horizontal side or component must be cos which is the same math works for the vertical side just with sine instead of cosine -- so weknow that the length of the vertical side is just sin which works out to be so our vector has a horizontal component of and a vertical component of in what s known as unit vector notation we d describe this vector as v i j the arrow on top of the v tells you it s a vector and the little hats on top of thei and j tell you that they re the unit vectors and they denote the direction for each vector i just means it s the direction of what we d normally call the x axis and j is the y axis you ll sometimes see another one k which represents the z axis and if we wanted to add or subtract two vectors that s easy enough -- we just separate themeach into their component parts and add or subtract each component separately so i j added to i j would just be i j and - i j added to i - j would be i - j multiplying by a scalar isn t a big deal either -- you just multiply the number byeach component so i j times would be i j the unit vector notation itself actually takes advantage of this kind of multiplicationi j and k are called unit vectors because they re vectors that are exactly one unitlong each pointing in the direction of a different axis so when you write i for example you re just saying take the unit vector i and make it twice as long but it s not the same as multiplying a vector by another vector -- that s a topic for another episode so now we know that a vector has two parts a magnitude and a direction and that it oftenhelps to describe it in terms of its components and when you separate a vector into its components they really are completely separate in other words changing a horizontal vector won t affect its vertical component and vice versa and we can test this idea pretty easily let s say you have two baseballs and you let go of them at the same time from the same height but you toss ball a in such a way that it ends up with some starting vertical velocity with ball b it s just dropped in this case ball a will hit the ground first because you gave it a head start now what happens if you repeat the experiment but this time you give ball a some horizontalvelocity and just drop ball b straight down which ball hits the ground first it s kind of a trick question because they actually land at the same time it doesn t matter how much starting horizontal velocity you give ball a -- it doesn t reach theground any more quickly because its horizontal motion vector has nothing to do with its vertical motion with this in mind let s go back to our pitching machine which we ll set up soit s pitching balls horizontally exactly a meter above the ground then we get out of the way and launch a ball assuming that up and right each are positive how do we figure out how long it takes to hit the ground that s easy enough -- we just completely ignore the horizontal component and use thekinetic equations the same way we ve been using them in this case the one we want is what we ve been calling the displacement curve equation -- it s this one we just add y subscripts to velocity and acceleration since we re specifically talking about thosequalities in the vertical direction now we can start plugging in numbers the ball s displacement on the left side of the equation is just - meter there s no starting vertical velocity since the machine is pointing sideways and the vertical acceleration is just the force of gravity now all we have to do is solve for time t and we learn that the ball took seconds to hit the ground its horizontal motion didn t affect its vertical motion in any way but sometimes things get a little more complicated -- like what about those pitches we werelaunching with a starting velocity of meters per second but at an angle of degrees well we can still talk about the ball s vertical and horizontal motion separately we just have to separate that velocity vector into its components just like we did earlier we can use trigonometry to get a starting horizontal velocity of m sand a starting vertical velocity of m s now we re equipped to answer all kinds of questions about the ball s horizontal or vertical motion here s one how long did it take for the ball to reach its highest point we already know something important about this mysterious maximum at that final point the ball s vertical velocity had to be zero that s because of something we ve talked about before when you reverse directions your velocity has to hit zero at least for that one moment before you head back the other way so in this case we know that the ball s starting vertical velocity was m s and we know that its final vertical velocity at that high point was m s finally we know that its vertical acceleration came from the force of gravity --so it was - m s since up is positive and we re looking for time t fortunately you know that there s a kinematic equation that fits this scenario perfectly-- the definition of acceleration by plugging in these numbers we find that it took the ball seconds to hit that maximum height so describing motion in more than one dimension isn t really all that different or complicated you just have to use the power of triangles in this episode you learned about vectors how to resolve them into components and how to add and subtract those components we also talked about how to use the kinematicequations to describe motion in each dimension separately crash

of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studio with the help of these amazing people and our graphics team is thought cafe ', 'we ve been talking a lot about the science of how things move -- you throw a ball in the air and there are ways to predict exactly how it will fall but there s something we ve been leaving out forces and why they make things accelerate and for that we re going to turn to a physicist you ve probably heard of isaac newton with his three laws published in in his book principia newton outlined his understanding of motion-- and a lot of his ideas were totally new today more than years later if you re trying to describe the effects of forces onjust about any everyday object -- a box on the ground a reindeer pulling a sleigh oran elevator taking you up to your apartment -- then you re going to want to use newton s laws and yes i ll explain the reindeer thing in a minute theme music newton s first law is all about inertia which is basically an object s tendencyto keep doing what it s doing it s often stated as an object in motion will remain in motion and an object at restwill remain at rest unless acted upon by a force which is just another way of saying that to change the way something moves -- to giveit acceleration -- you need a net force so how do we measure inertia well the most important thing to know is mass say you have two balls that are thesame size but one is an inflatable beach ball and the other is a bowling ball the bowling ball is going to be harder to move and harder to stop once it s moving it has more inertia because it has more mass makes sense right more mass means more stuff with a tendency to keep doing what it wasdoing before your force came along and interrupted it and this idea connects nicely to newton s second law net force is equal to mass x acceleration or as an equation f net ma it s important to remember that we re talking about net force here -- the amountof force left over once you ve added together all the forces that might cancel each other out let s say you have a hockey puck sitting on a perfectly frictionless ice rink and i know ice isn tperfectly frictionless but stick with it if you re pushing the puck along witha stick that s a force on it - that isn t being canceled out by anything else so the puck is experiencing acceleration but when the puck is just sitting still or even when it s sliding across the ice afteryou ve pushed it then all the forces are balanced out that s what s known as equilibrium an object that s in equilibrium can still be moving like the sliding puck but its velocity won t be changing it s when the forces get unbalanced that you start to see the exciting stuff happen and probably the most common case of a net force making something move is the gravitational force say you throw a kg ball straight up in the air -- and then yknow get out of the way because that could really hurt if it hits you but the force of gravity is pulling down on the ball which is accelerating downward at a rate of m s so the net force is equal to m a but the only force acting here is gravity this means that if we could measure the acceleration of the ball we d be able to calculate the force of gravity and we can measure the acceleration -- it s m s the value we ve been calling small g so the force of gravity on the ball must be kg which is the mass of the ball times small gwhich comes to kilograms times meters per second squared we use this equation for gravity so much that it s often just written as f g mg that s how you determine the force of gravity otherwise known as weight now those units can be a bit of a mouthful so we just call them newtons that s right we measure weight in newtons in honor of sir isaac and not kilograms kilograms are a measure of mass but gravity often isn t the only force acting on the object so when we re trying to calculate a net force we usually have to take into account more than just gravity this is where we get into one of the forces that tends to show up a lot which is explained by newton s third law you probably know this law as for every action there s an equal but opposite reaction which just means that if you exert a force on an object it exerts an equal force back on you and that s what we call the normal force normal in this instance means perpendicular and the normal force is always perpendicularto whatever surface your object is resting on at least it is when you re pushing on something big and macroscopic like a table if you put a book down on a table the normal force is pushing -- and therefore pointing -- up but if you put it on a ramp then the normal force is pointing perpendicular to the ramp now the normal force isn t like most other forces it s special because it changes its magnitude say you have a piece of aluminum foil stretched tightly across the top of a bowl and thenyou put one lonely grape on top of it because of gravity that grape is exerting a little bit of force on the foil and thenormal force pushes right back with the same amount but then you add another grape which doubles the force on the foil -- in that case the normal force doubles too that ll keep happening until eventually you add enough grapes that they break through the foil that s what happens when the normal force can t match the force pushing against it but what does newton s famous third law really mean though when i push on this desk with my finger right now i m applying a force to it and it s applying an equal force right back on my finger -- one that i can actually feel but if that s true -- and it is -- then why are we able to move things how can i pick up this mug or how can a reindeer pull a sleigh basically things can move because there s more going on than just the action and reaction forces for example when a reindeer pulls on a sleigh newton s third law tells us that the sleighis pulling back on it with equal force but the reindeer can still move the sleigh forward because it s standing on the ground when it takes a step it s pushing backward on the ground with its foot -- amp the ground is pushing it forward meanwhile the reindeer is also pulling on the sleigh while the sleigh is pulling right back but the force from the ground pushing the reindeer forward is stronger than theforce from the sleigh pulling it back so the animal accelerates forward and so does the sleigh so one takeaway here is that there would be no christmas without physics but now that we have an idea of some of the forces we might encounter let s describewhat s happening when a box is sitting on the ground the first thing to do -- which is the first thing you should always do when you re solvinga problem like this -- is draw what s known as a free body diagram basically you draw a rough outline of the object put a dot in the middle and thendraw and label arrows to represent all the forces we also have to decide which direction is positive -- in this case we ll choose up to be positive for our box the free body diagram is pretty simple there s an arrow pointing down representing the force of gravity and an arrow pointing up representing the forceof the ground pushing back on the box since the box is staying still we know that it s not accelerating which tells us thatthose forces are equal so the net force is equal to but what if you attach a rope to the top of the box then connect it to the ceiling sothe box is suspended in the air your net force is still because there s no acceleration on the box and gravity isstill pulling down in the same way it was before but now the counteracting upward force comes from the rope acting on the box in what we call the tension force to make our examples simpler we almost always assume that ropes have no mass and are completelyunbreakable -- no matter how much you pull on them they ll pull right back which means that the tension force isn t fixed if the box weighs newtons then thetension in the rope is also newtons but if we add another newtons of weight thetension in the rope will become newtons kind of like how the normal force changes with the grapes on the foil but in this case it s in response to a pulling force instead of a push the key is that no matter what you can add the forces together to give you a particularnet force -- even though that net force might not always be like in an elevator so let s say you re in an elevator -- or as i call them a lift the total mass of the lift including you is kg and its movement is controlledby a counterweight attached to a pulley the plan is to set up a counterweight of kg and then let the lift go once you let go the lift is going to start accelerating downward - because it s heavier than the counterweight and the hope is that the counterweight will keep it from accelerating too much but how will we know if it s safe how quickly is the lift going to accelerate downward to find out first let s draw a free body diagram for the lift making up the positive direction the force of gravity on the lift is pulling it down and it s equal to the mass of the lift x small g -- newtons of force in the negative direction and the force of tension is pulling the lift up in the positive direction which means that for the lift the net force is equal to the tension force minus the mass of the lift x small g now since newton s first law tells us that f net ma we can set all of that to beequal to the lift s mass times some downward acceleration -a that s what we re trying to solve for so let s do the same thing for the counterweight gravity is pulling it down with n of force in the negative direction and again the force of tension is pulling it up so that the net force is equal to thetension force minus the mass of the counterweight times small g and again because of newton s second law we know that all of that is equal to the massof the counterweight times that same acceleration a -- which is positive this time sincethe counterweight is moving upward so putting that all together we end up with two equations -- and two unknowns we don t have a value for the tension force and we don t have a value for acceleration but what we re trying to solve for is the acceleration so we use algebra to do that when you have a system of equations like this you can add or subtract all the terms on eachside of the equals sign to turn them into one equation for example if you know that and that you can subtract the firstequation from the second to get and in our case with the lift subtracting the first equation from the second gets ridof the term that represents the tension force we now just have to solve for acceleration -- meaning we need to rearrange the equation to set everything equal to a we end up with an equation that really just says that a is equal to the differencebetween the weights -- or the net force on the system -- divided by the total mass essentially this is just a fancier version of f net ma and we can solve that for a which turns out to be m s which is not that much acceleration at all so as long as you aren t dropping too far down you should be fine even if the landing is a little bumpy in this episode you learned about newton s three laws of motion how inertia works thatnet force is equal to mass x acceleration how physicists define equilibrium and allabout the normal force and the tension force crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head overto their channel to check out amazing shows like braincraft it s ok to be smart and pbs idea channel this episode of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our graphics team is thought cafe ', 'this episode of crash course physics is sponsored by audible if you watched our episode on newton s laws of motion then you re practically an expert on forces and the way they make things accelerate but there s something we left out -- something important when you re trying todescribe how things move in real life friction it stops a baseball player sliding into home plate and it s the reason i can pick up this cup without it slipping through my fingers without friction it would be tough to do almost anything but it also makes doing other things pretty hard anyone who has moved furniture knows that luckily friction is also a force so as physicists we know what to do with it theme music you re moving into a new house and you ask a friend to come help out which he does because he s just nice like that and you really do need his help because you ll have to move giant bookcases and a desk and you can t do all of that on your own and about halfway through the move-in you re rearranging the furniture in your new bedroomwhen you run into a problem you re pushing and pushing on your bookcase but it just not sliding across the floor so you call your friend over from the other room and with both of you pushing the bookcase finally starts to slide but it was really hard to get it moving -- and stay moving -- because there s a force workingagainst you - stopping the bookcase from sliding friction and there are actually two kinds of friction first there s kinetic friction -- that s the force that slows the bookcase down as it slides and there s also static friction the force you had to overcome to get it moving in the first place so let s talk about kinetic friction first it s a resistive force which just means that no matter what it ll act to resist you in other words if you push the bookcase so it slides to the left then the force of kineticfriction is acting to the right but if you move the bookcase to the right then the friction will resist to the left kinetic friction will also often generate heat or sound or both so what causes it the bookcase and the wood floor might look smooth but if you looked at their surfacesunder a microscope you d see that they re covered in tiny bumps and grooves as the bookcase slides across the floor the surfaces catch on each other and might even start to form weak intermolecular bonds that pulls on the bookcase slowing it down but as the bookcase continues to slide it breaks those bonds and moves past whatever bumps it was stuck on the newly-freed molecules start to spring back and the movement produces heat and sound then the cycle continues with the next patch of floor you end up with a force that resists any kind of sliding movement and its strength dependspartly on what materials are sliding against each other rougher materials have more surfaces to catch on each other which is why the bookcase willbe easier to slide on the wood floor than if you d tried it on carpet and the way in which this roughness affects kinetic friction is called the coefficient of kinetic friction and it s different for pretty much every combination of materials but there s another factor at work in friction how hard the materials are pressed together puts more of their surfaces in contact with each other and that s where the normal force or f n comes in you might remember from our last episode that when a force pushes a bookcase againstthe floor the floor pushes right back that s newton s third law and we call the force from the floor on the bookcase the normal force in this case the force from the bookcase on the floor is just its weight mg so the normal force would be equal to mg but pointing up -- equal and opposite so - now we know about the two main factors that affect the strength of kinetic friction the coefficient of kinetic friction -- written as mu k -- and the normal force f n it shouldn t be too surprising then that the equation for kinetic friction is just the coefficient times the normal force but that s only half the picture what about static friction when you weren t able to move the bookcase to begin with that was because of the staticfriction between the bookcase and the floor like kinetic friction it s also a resistive force but not only can its direction change -- its strength can too say you push on the bookcase lightly with just one hand and it doesn t move since it doesn t have any acceleration the bookcase must be in equilibrium --meaning that the forces on it balance out so the force from static friction must be exactly equal to the force from your hand but in the opposite direction -- because of that equilibrium it s not the same as the normal force and it has nothing to do with newton s third law but say you really put your back into it pushing as hard as you can the bookcase still doesn t move so static friction must still be pushing back with the same amount of force you are however the static friction between two objects can change once your friend starts pushing too the bookcase starts to slide because the force from yourteamwork is greater than the maximum amount of static friction -- which we write like this and the relationship between the maximum static friction and the normal force is similar tothe relationship between kinetic friction and the normal force there s even a coefficient of static friction which measures the roughness between any twoobjects -- and we just write it as mu s and the maximum force of static friction is just equal to the coefficient of static friction times the normal force so now we know the equations for both kinds of friction and where they come from which means we can use that information to figure out how to solve problems involving friction just like with the other force-related problems we start with a free body diagram that helps sort out what s pushing where so we can get an overview of the situation next we decide on some axes where are x and y and which way is positive that ll be useful when ramps come up because if we want we can just decide that x pointsdown the ramp and y points straight into it the next thing we ll need to do is separate vectors into components along our new x and y axisbecause strange things happen to the normal force when you have something like that bookcase sitting on a ramp the normal force is pointing out of the ramp because it s perpendicular to the surface but it s not equal and opposite to the force of gravity because that s pointing straight down instead we ll have to use trigonometry to separate the force of gravity into twoperpendicular components one pointing down along the ramp and one pointing into it then the normal force will just be equal and opposite to the part of the gravitationalforce that s pointing into the ramp so here s how to separate and diagram everything that s going on the angle between the force of gravity and the component pointing into the ramp is called theta and it s the same as the incline of the ramp those make two sides of a right triangle and since the component pointing into theramp is adjacent to the angle we know that it s equal to mg x the cosine of that angle -- and so is the normal force the other component pointing alongside the ramp is opposite the angle so again using trigonometry we know that it s equal to mg x the sine of the angle so you ve drawn your free-body diagram you ve decided on axes and separated theforce of gravity into two useful components now we can finally set up our equations that s where newton s second law --f net ma -- comes in handy there ll actually be two of these -- one for the x direction down the ramp and onefor the y direction into the ramp so let s say you ve got the bookcase where it needs to go and now you re ready toget something else out of the moving van -- this time a -kilogram box with a very fragile vase inside it it s heavy so let s say you put it down on the ramp leading from the back of the truckto the ground -- which happens to be angled at degrees -- and then walk away to get a drink of water you also happen to know that the coefficient of static friction between the box and the ramp is what is the box s acceleration if it s zero it ll stay put and your vase should be okay when you walk away from it if not that means the box will start sliding down the ramp and you may have a problem the first thing we need to do is draw a free-body diagram of this box for our coordinate system we ll have x along the ramp with the positive side at the bottom and y perpendicular to the surface of the ramp with the positive side also toward the bottom and we have a whole bunch of forces here the normal force is pointing out of the ramp there s also the force of static friction which right now is pointing up the ramp -since it s resisting the part of the gravitational force pulling the box down speaking of which the force of gravity is pointing straight down --not along either of our axes so we separate it into components mg cos theta pointing into the ramp and mg sin theta pointing down along the ramp now we set up our net force equations along each axis the box isn t going anywhere along the y axis -- nothing s going to make it startrising above the surface of the ramp right so we know that all the forces acting along the y axis should add up to zero since they re all balanced out but the forces along the x axis along the ramp are a different story if the box has no acceleration it s standing still or moving at a constant velocity they ll also add up to zero but if it does have acceleration along the ramp then the forces will add up to its mass times that acceleration so to figure out if the box slides all we need to do is find out if the part of the gravitational forcepushing it down the ramp mg sin theta is greater than the maximum static friction resisting it in other words if down the ramp is the positive direction is the net force positive or zero the forces here are the gravitational force pushing the box down the ramp mg sin theta and the maximum static friction but we write the maximum static friction as negative becauseit s pointing in the negative direction on our x-axis -- up the ramp so adding them together we get this equation multiplying together the different values that make up mg sin theta we find that it s equal to newtons and the maximum static friction is just equal to the coefficient of static friction x the normal force -- so plugging in the numbers we find that it s newtons which means that the net force is newtons so yes there s a net force pushing the box down the ramp and it s going to slide which means i have some bad news for you about that vase but today you learned about the two types of friction kinetic friction and static friction and how they act to resist applied forces we also talked about how to use friction to describe an object s motion including how to calculate the normal force when that object s on a ramp finally we calculated whether a box on a ramp would start sliding down this episode of crash course physics is supported by audible comright now audible is offering viewers a -day

crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our graphics team is thought cafe ', 'ever been on one of those twirly carnival rides you know the ones where you get into a giant cylinder and stand against the wall and then they spin you around like a wet salad if you ve had that uniquely nauseating experience then you know that the simple act of spinning in a circle can be intense it also happens to be one of the most misunderstood concepts in newtonian physics it s known as uniform circular motion and it s what occurs when anything moves along a circular path in a consistent way most of the confusion about this idea has to do with the fact that things accelerate inward as they move in a circle --a kind of acceleration known as centripetal acceleration but you ll often hear people talking aboutcentrifugal acceleration pushing things outward as they move in a circle that s actually where centrifuges get their name and centrifugal acceleration isn t wrong exactly it s just not real so to explain how things really acceleratewhen they move in circles let s talk about the physics of that ride as it spins you around-- assuming you re willing to risk stepping inside i m getting dizzy just thinking about it theme music in nasa was getting ready to send people to space they knew that a big part of space flight would involve acceleration so they wanted to test how much acceleration people could handle before they d black out because that s what happens when too much blood is forced away from your brain for too long so engineers tested potential astronauts by putting them in a human centrifuge --basically a superpowered version of those rides at the fair they found that most people could withstand an acceleration of around meters per second squared for minutes --that s about ten times the acceleration caused by gravity that you d feel just by jumping in the air with that in mind let s say we ve been asked to calculate the safety of one of those carnival rides --which means we ll need to figure out how much acceleration riders would experience there are equations we can use to do that because just like with all the other kindsof motion we ve talked about so far uniform circular motion has four main qualities --position velocity acceleration and time and they re all related to each other when it comes to uniform circular motion position is the most obvious quality there s an object and it s on a circular path but velocity is a little less intuitive at any given moment velocity tells you how fast the object s going and in what direction and that direction is not along the path of the circle it s actually perpendicular to the radius of the circle -- along what we call a tangent so if you draw an arrow representing the velocity on the circle it ll only touch the circle in one spot ok bear with me here as this might seem kinda strange but it s true one of the nice things about the physics of motion is that often you can just try it out for yourself and see what happens so here s a quick way to see tangential velocity in action all you need is some string a key -- or some other small object to tiethe string to -- and a wide open space so nobody gets hurt by a key flying around move the string so the key starts twirling around in counterclockwise circles parallelto the ground then when the key is at the point in the circle that s farthest awayfrom you let go of the string the key flies to the left here s why in earlier episodes we ve talked about inertia and the idea that ifan object is in motion it ll remain in that motion unless it s acted upon by anet external force which means that something moving in a straightline is going to continue moving in a straight line unless a force -- one that isn t balancedout by other forces -- turns it whenever you see something turning there s a net external force acting on it that s why at any given moment the velocityof an object moving in a circle will be tangent to it without a force to turn it it justflies in whatever direction it was moving last once you let go of the string you gotrid of the force that was making the key turn in circles so it kept moving with the same velocity that it had at the exact moment you let go -- perpendicularto the string connecting it to your hand which was the center of the key s circularpath and now we can finally talk about the mysterious force that was accelerating thekey -- changing the direction of its velocity so that it moved in a circle that force is the same reason riders on the human centrifuge spin in a circle -- in fact it s the reason anything moves in a circle that force is known as the centripetal force and the acceleration it causes is called centripetal acceleration and the important thing to remember about centripetal acceleration is that it s alwaysdirected toward the center of the circular path that makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of how the velocity s changing the key was only turning in circles because your hand was pulling it toward the centerof a circular path but now think about what it s like to beon one of those centrifuge rides -- or if you ve never subjected yourself to one what it s like to be in a car that turns sharply the ride -- or the car -- is turningin a circle so there must be centripetal acceleration pushing you toward the middleof that circle except it feels like you re being pushedoutward people often attribute this sensation to centrifugal force but that s not real the reason that people confuse the centripetal force with what feels like a centrifugalforce comes down to a change in perspective -- what physicists call a frame of reference from the frame of reference of someone standing outside the human centrifuge it s easyto see what s actually happening as the cylinder turns it forces the people insideit to move in a circle and the wall is pressing on them to keep them turning -- it s actuallypushing them toward the center of the circle but the person inside the cylinder just seeseverything moving around with them from their frame of reference it feels likethey re just being squashed against the wall -- as though there s a centrifugalforce acting on them but there s nothing there to actually createthat force which is why physicists call it a fictitious force -- it doesn t really exist so now that we know how acceleration workswhen you re moving in a circle we can finally come up with some ways to connect position velocity and acceleration -- and figure out if that centrifuge ride is safe for people but first we have to talk about time when something s moving around a circle in aconsistent way -- in other words its acceleration is constant -- it ll take a certain amountof time to return to its starting conditions in this case those starting conditions area particular point along the circular path we call that time the period of the motion and the variable we use to represent it is a capital t which isn t too hard to remember as long as you keep in mind that the period is anamount of time from timing the centrifuge ride in action we know that it takes secondsto spin around once so we d say that the period of its motion is seconds but sometimes it s easier to talk about the same idea in another way -- how many revolutionsdoes the ride make in one second that s what we d call the frequency of the motion-- which we write as an f in equations that s simple enough to figure out if ittakes the ride seconds to make one revolution then it s making one half of a revolutionper second it s also not too difficult to relate period and frequency with an equation frequency is just divided by the period now that we ve gotten time out of the way let s talk about position we generally talk about distance in terms of the circumferenceof the circle because that tells us how many times you ve gone around the circle in other words if a centrifuge rider covers the same distance as one circumference weknow they ve made one revolution and circumference is just times pi times the radius of thecircle so if that human centrifuge has a radius of meters riders would travel meters every revolution now what about their speed well in ourepisodes on motion in a straight line we talked about how average velocity is generallyequal to the change in position over the change in time -- -- which turns out to be a greatway to describe the speed of uniform circular motion when the rider s made one revolution around the circle they ve covered a distance equalto times pi times r -- or in this case meters that s how far they ve traveled and the amount of time it took was equal to the period of the ride s motion that stheir change in time divide the distance they ve traveled bytheir change in time and you get the speed equation for uniform circular motion usingthat equation we can calculate the speed of a rider on the centrifuge -- it s meters per second next getting the equation for the magnitudeof centripetal acceleration -- how strong it is basically -- is a little less straightforward that magnitude will be equal to the change in velocity over the change in time at any givenmoment -- in other words its derivative actually calculating the derivative canget complicated but it turns out to be equal to the speed squared divided by the radiusof the circle this equation makes a lot of sense for a fewreasons first take a look at the units acceleration is measured in meters per secondsquared so we already know that whatever the equation for centripetal accelerationis the units have to work out to meters per second squared and they do square the speed and you end up with units of meters squared per secondsquared just divide those units by meters and you get meters per second squared youcan also tell from this equation that if you increase your speed along the circular pathor decrease the radius of that path you should end up with a higher acceleration and that relationship between acceleration speed and radius checks out in real life too try spinning the key on a string faster or shortening the string but spinning it atthe same speed you ll feel the key pulling harder on your fingers because it s experiencingmore acceleration and now that we have an equation for the accelerationthat riders would experience on the centrifuge we can finally figure out if that ride issafe we already know that their speed would be meters per second and that the radiusof the ride is meters so according to the equation for acceleration their acceleration would be meters per second squared that s about half the accelerationthat nasa found would make people black out so the ride is probably safe at least fora couple of minutes whether that much acceleration would be pleasant is a different story -- buthey we re just here to make sure the ride is safe we re not responsible for cleaningup the vomit once it s over today you learned that when an object isin uniform circular motion its velocity is tangent to the circle and its accelerationis pointing inward we also talked about the difference between centripetal and centrifugalforces and derived equations for period frequency velocity and acceleration crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head overto their channel to check out amazing shows like deep look the

thought cafe ', 'when people say that isaac newton completely transformed the field of physics they really aren t kidding now we ve already talked about his three laws of motion which we use to describe how things move but another of newton s famous contributions to physics was his understanding of gravity when newton was first starting out scientists concept of gravity was pretty much nonexistent i mean they knew that when you dropped something it fell to the ground and from careful observation they knew that planets and moons orbited in a particular way what they didn t know was that those two concepts were connected of course just like with motion we now know that there s a lot more to gravity thanwhat newton was able to observe even so when it comes to describing the effects of gravity on the scale of say our solar system newton s law of universal gravitation is incredibly useful and it all started with an apple probably theme music odds are you ve been told the story of newton s apple at some point the story goes that one day he was sitting under an apple tree in his mother s garden when an apple fell out of the tree that s when newton had his grand realization something was pulling that apple down to earth and that led to another idea what if the apple was pulling on earth too but you justcouldn t tell because the effect of the apple s force on earth was less obvious a few years later newton was sitting in the same garden when he had another stroke of inspiration what if the same force that pulled the apple to the ground could affect things much fartherfrom earth s surface -- like the moon it was kind of counterintuitive because the moon orbits earth instead of crashing straightinto the ground like an apple that falls off a tree but newton realized that the moon was still being pulled toward earth -- it was just movingsideways so quickly that it kept missing that s what was keeping it in orbit if gravity was keeping the moon in orbit what if it affected the behavior of any two objects --like a planet orbiting the sun that s the official version of the story -- the one newton himself used to tell most historians think he was embellishing at least a little but there probably is some truth to it whether or not the thing with the apple actually happened newton thought his idea seemed promising the idea that gravity might affect everything including the orbits of other planets and moons so he started looking for an equation that would accurately describe the way the gravitational force made objects behave --whether it was an apple falling on the ground or the moon orbiting earth newton knew that however this gravitational force worked it would probably behave likeany other net force on an object -- it would be equal to that object s mass times its acceleration the mass part was easy enough -- it would just be the mass of the apple or the moon it was going to be a little harder to figure out the factors that were affecting the acceleration part of the equation the first thing newton realized he d have to take into account was distance when an object is close to the earth s surface like an apple in a tree gravity makes itaccelerate at about meters per second squared but the moon has an acceleration that s only about a th of that falling apple the moon also happens to be about times as far from the center of earth as that apple would be --and squared is so newton figured that the gravitational force between two objects must get smaller the farther apart they are more specifically it must depend on the distance between the two objects squared then there was mass not the mass of the apple or the moon -- the mass of the other object involved in thegravitational dance in this case earth newton realized that the greater the masses of the two objects pulling on each other the stronger the gravitational force would be between them once he d taken into account the distance between two objects and their masses newton had most of his equation for the way gravity behaved the gravitational force was proportional to the mass of the two objects multiplied together divided by the square of the distance between them but it had to be a lot smaller or else you d see a force pulling together most everyday objects like that rubik s cube is staying right where it is instead of being pulled towards me so the gravitational force between us must be very small so newton added a constant to his equation -- a very small number that would make thegravitational force just a tiny fraction of what you d calculate otherwise he called it g and he called this full equation f gmm r the law of universal gravitation newton had no idea what number big g would be though he just knew it would be a tinynumber and put the letter g into his equation as a placeholder about a century later henry cavendish another british scientist made careful measurementswith some of the most sensitive instruments of the time and figured out that g was equalto about - n m kg so indeed newton was right about big g having to be quite small but even though he didn t know the exact value of big g at the time newton had enough to establish his law of universal gravitation he described gravity as a force between any objects and published his equation for calculating that force then newton took things a step further -- well technically three steps further about years earlier an astronomer named johannes kepler had come up with three lawsthat described the way orbits worked and those predictions almost perfectly matched the orbits that astronomers were seeing in the sky so newton knew that his law of universal gravitation had to fit with kepler s laws or he d have to find some way to explain why kepler was wrong luckily for newton his law of gravitation not only fit with kepler s laws he was able to use it in combination with his three laws of motion and calculus to prove kepler s laws according to kepler the orbits of the planets were ellipses -- as opposed to circles --with the sun at one focus of the ellipse -- one of the two central points used to describe how the ellipse curves and that s what s known as kepler s first law and it actually applies to any ellipticalorbit -- not just those of the planets our moon s orbit around earth is also an ellipse and earth is at one focus of that ellipse kepler s second law was that if you draw a line from a planet to the sun it ll alwayssweep out the same-sized area within a given amount of time when earth is at its farthest point from the sun for example over the course of one daywe ll have covered an area that looks like a very long very thin kinda-lopsided pizza slice and when we re at our closest point to the sun one day s worth of the orbit will sweepout an area that s more like a short fat pizza slice kepler s second law tells us that if we measure them both those two pizza sliceswill have the exact same area his third law is a little more technical but it s basically an observation aboutwhat happens when you take the longest -- or semimajor -- radius of a planet s orbitand cube it then divide that by the period of the planet s orbit squared according to kepler that ratio should be the same for every single planet --and now we know that it is almost exactly for every single planet that orbits our sun that ratio is either or and newton was able to explain why the actual observed orbits in the night sky sometimesdeviated very slightly from kepler s predictions -- for example by having those slightly different ratios what kepler didn t know and newton figured out was that the planets and moons were allpulling on each other and sometimes that pull was strong enough to change their orbits just a little bit there s one more thing we should point out about newton s law of universal gravitation which is that it fits what we expect the equation for a net force should look like according to newton from newton s second law of motion we know that a net force is equal to mass times acceleration what the law of universal gravitation is saying is that when the net force acting on an objectcomes from gravity the acceleration is equal to the mass of the bigger object -- like earth --divided by the distance between the two objects times big g so you know how we ve been describing the gravitational acceleration at earth s surface as small g well small g is actually equal to big g times earth s mass divided by earth s radius squared math and we can use this equation for gravitational acceleration to help nasa out with a challengethey re grappling with right now we want to send humans to mars but we have to make sure that their spacesuits will workproperly in martian gravity one way that nasa tests spacesuits is by flying astronauts on special planes --sometimes called vomit comets they fly in arcs that let the spacesuit-testers experience reduced weight -- or none at all-- for short periods of time to simulate martian gravity the flight plan will need to aim for the gravitational accelerationyou d experience if you started hopping around on the surface of mars so what would that acceleration be well from newton s law of universal gravitation we know that the acceleration of stuff atmars s surface would be equal to big g times the mass of mars divided by mars s radius squared we also happen to know mars s mass and radius already which helps so plugging in the numbers we can calculate the gravitational acceleration at mars s surface it should be about meters per second squared that s the acceleration you d experience on mars and what the vomit comet pilots try to attain when they fly --about of the acceleration that you experience when you jump off the ground here on earth so hundreds of years after newton s day nasa is still using his math yeah i d say he was a pretty big deal today you learned about how newton came up with his law of universal gravitation we also talked about kepler s three laws and calculated the gravitational acceleration on the surface of mars crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head overto their channel to check out amazing shows like deep look the good stuff and pbs space time this episode of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'when i say work what s the first thing that comes to mind maybe a cubicle or a briefcase or that history exam that s coming up soon but if you re a physicist work has a very specific meaning -- one that has very little to dowith spreadsheets or the fall of the roman empire today we re going to explore that definition -- and how it connects to one of the mostimportant principles in physics conservation of energy we ll also learn what physicists mean when they talk about another concept that comesup a lot in daily life power so let s get to work theme music so far in this course we ve spent most of our time talking about forces and the way they make things move and you need to understand forces before you can understand work because work is what happens when you apply a force over a certain distance to a system --a system just being whatever section of the universe you h appen to be talking about at the time for example if you re using a rope to drag a box across the floor we might say thatthe box is your system and the force you re using to pull on it is an external force so let s say you re pulling on this box-system by dragging it straight behind you so the rope is parallel to the ground if you use the rope to pull the box for one meter we d say that you re doing work on the box and the amount of work you re doing is equal to the force you re using to pull the box times the distance you moved it for example if you pulled the rope -- and therefore the box -- with a force of newtons while you moved it meters then we d say that you did newton-meters of work on the box more commonly however work is expressed in units known as joules now sometimes the force you apply to an object won t be in exactly the same directionas the direction in which the object is moving like if you tried to drag the box with your hand higher than the box so that the rope was at an angle to the floor in that case the box would move parallel to the floor but the force would be at an angle to it and in such an instance you d have to use one the tricks we learned back when we first talked about vectors specifically you must separate the force you re using on the rope into its component parts one that s parallel to the floor and one that s perpendicular to it to find the part of the force that s parallel to the floor -- that is the one that s actually pulling the box forward --you just have to multiply the magnitude of the force by the cosine of the rope s angle to the ground you ll remember that we typically designate an angle in a system as theta so to calculate the work you did on the box you just multiply the horizontal component-- or f times the cosine of theta -- by the distance you moved the box that s one way physicists often write the equation for work -- they ll set it equalto force times distance times the cosine of theta and that equation will fit any scenario that involves a constant force being applied over a certain distance but what if the force isn t constant what if say you started out pulling hard on the box but then you started to get tired so the amount of force you exerted on the box got smaller and smaller the farther you dragged it to calculate the work you did in that case you d have to count up the amount of forceyou applied over each tiny little bit of distance and if you ve watched our episodes on calculus then you know that there s a faster wayto add together infinitely tiny increments integration so to find the work done by a varying force you just have to integrate that force relativeto the distance the object moved which would look like this but force-times-distance is only one of the ways that physicists measure work because you know how we just said that joules are the units of work well joules are often used as the units for something else energy and work uses the same units as energy because work is just a change in energy it s what happens when an external force is applied to a system and changes the energy of that system in fact that s one of the ways to define energy -- it s the ability to do work there are all different kinds of energy but in this episode we ll mainly be talking about two of them kinetic energy and potential energy kinetic energy is the energy of motion when the box was resting on the ground we d say that it had no kinetic energy but once you applied a force and it started moving it did have kinetic energy and the energy of the box changed which means that you did work on it more specifically the kinetic energy of an object is equal to half of its mass times its velocity squared if this looks familiar that s because it comes from applying both newton s secondlaw and the kinematic equations to the idea that work is equal to force times distance so if the box had a mass of kilograms and at some point while you were draggingit it reached a velocity of meters per second we d say that its kinetic energyat that moment was joules then there s potential energy which actually isn t what it sounds like potential energy isn t potentially energy -- it s potentially work in other words potential energy is energy that could be used to do work one common type of potential energy is gravitational potential energy -- basically the potential energy that comes from the fact that gravity exists if i hold this book a meter above the ground we d say that it has gravitational potential energy because if you let it go then gravity is going to do work on the book gravity exerted a force that moves it to the ground once the book hits the ground though we d say that its gravitational potential energyis zero because gravity can t do work on it anymore calculating gravitational potential energy is easy enough it s just the force of gravity on the object -- so the object s mass times small g --multiplied by the object s height or mgh for short which means that just by knowing that this book s mass is about a kilogram and thatit s a meter above the ground we can calculate its potential energy which is joules another type of potential energy that shows up a lot is spring potential energy despite its name this is not a seasonal thing -- and yes i really made that joke rather it s the type of potential energy that s specific to springs the force of a spring is equal to the distance by which it s either compressed or stretched times a constant that we write as k this equation is known as hooke s law after british physicist robert hooke who came up with it in now the constant k -- also called the spring constant -- is different for each spring and it s a measure of the spring s stiffness and the equation makes total sense if you think about it the further you push on the spring and the stiffer it is the harder it will resist you even can test this out for yourself by taking apart a clicky pen and playing with the spring inside by combining hooke s law with the idea that work equals force times distance we can find the potential energy from a spring it s half times k times the distance squared for example if you have a spring with a spring constant of newtons per meter and a blockis compressing it by half a meter then the potential energy of the block would be joules so when something does work on a system its energy changes but how that energy changes depends on the system some systems can lose energy these are known as a non-conservative systems now that doesn t mean that the energy that s lost is literally disappearing from the universe and it doesn t have anything to do with the system s personal politics either it just relates to one of the most fundamental principles of science that energy can neither be created or destroyed but systems can lose energy like when friction from the box dragging on the floor generates heat for non-conservative systems you can still talk about their kinetic energy or potential energy at any given moment but conservative systems let you do much more than that a conservative system is one that doesn t lose energy through work say a simple pendulum when the pendulum is at the top of its swing it stops moving for a brief moment as it changes direction --meaning that its kinetic energy at that point is zero but it has lots of potential energy because the gravitational force can do work on thependulum pulling it down until it reaches the bottom of its swing at the bottom of the swing that potential energy becomes zero because gravity can t pull the pendulum down anymore but now the pendulum has lots of kinetic energy because it s moving through the swing and it turns out that at any given point in the pendulum s motion its kinetic energyand its potential energy will add up to the same number if its potential energy increases its kinetic energy will decrease by the exact same amount and vice versa so now that we know how to define work we can use that definition to help explain anothercommon term that physicists have a very specific meaning for power or more specifically average power average power is defined as work over time and it s measured in watts which is just another way of saying joules per second basically it s used to measure how much energy is converted from one type to another over time so remember that box you were pulling we figured out that you did joules of work on the box when you moved it meters if it took you seconds to move the box then your average power output was watts you re basically a lightbulb now we can also describe power in another way by putting two different facts together one that work is equal to force times distance and two that average velocity is equal to distance over timeknowing this we can say that power is the net force applied to something with a particular average velocity if you moved the box meters in seconds then its average velocity was meters per second and we already said that you were pulling the box along with a force of newtons so the force you were using to pull the box times the box s average velocity wouldalso give you an average power output of watts the two equations for average power are really describing the same relationship they re just using different qualities to do it we re going to be talking about power a lot when we discuss electricity in later episodes it s the best way to calculate how energy moves around in a circuit but that s a story for another day for now our work is done today you learned the two equations we can use to describe work and that energy is the ability to do work we also talked about kinetic and potential energy and how they play into non-conservative and conservative systems finally we found two different equations for power crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head over to their channel to check out amazing shows like the art assignment pbs idea

thought cafe ', 'you and i have explored the rules that govern lots of different moving objects so far but physics isn t just about dragging blocks up inclines or astronauts floating in vomit comets there are also collisions and physics has a lot to say about collisions -- whether it s two billiard balls knockingagainst each other or what happens when you fail at a super mario level for the th timeand throw your controller at the floor stupid lava sticks to figure out what s happening when objects collide we ll have to take into accounttwo main qualities momentum and impulse we ll also discuss what physicists mean when they talk about center of mass and why that s important and we ll have our old friend isaac newton to help us out along the way theme music remember newton s second law that s the one that says the net force on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration except that s not actually what newton said he really said that an object s so-called quantity of motion was equal to its mass times its velocity and the net force is equal to the change in that mass-times-velocity over time in other words it s the derivative of mass-times-velocity with respect to time and if you were to calculate that derivative you d find that the net force is just equal to mass times acceleration but putting newton s second law in terms of mass and velocity introduces an aspectof motion that we haven t talked about yet newton didn t really give this aspect a name but we will it s called momentum and it s one of those things that s easier to see in real life than to describe momentum is often described as an object s tendency to remain in motion but technically it s an object s mass times its velocity so a big bag full of leaves rolling down a hill it might be going fast but it doesn thave much mass so it doesn t have a lot of momentum and it wouldn t be too hard to stop but the boulder chasing indiana jones that had a lot of mass -- and therefore lots of momentum so it would have been much harder to stop and momentum is one factor that affects collisions between objects after all if a huge boulder crashes into another huge boulder that s going to bea very different sort of crash than if a bag of leaves crashes into a boulder but the other quality of a collision that we often consider is known as impulse which-- at least in the context of physics -- doesn t actually have anything to do with willpower or why you throw your game controller when you get stuck on a level instead impulse -- usually represented by a j -- is the integral of the net force onan object over time -- in other words its change in momentum impulse turns out to be a particularly useful way to describe a crash --because generally in collisions forces change very quickly so if a ball smacks into a wall and over the course of half a second its force onthe wall in newtons is equal to the time multiplied by we d say that its impulse was newton-seconds now let s consider the different kinds of collisions that we can study generally collisions can be described as either elastic or inelastic and it s going to be important to figure out which kind you re dealing with because the math works in very different ways if elastic collisions sound bouncy that s because they are like the conservative systems we talked about last time in elastic collisions kinetic energy is neither created nor destroyed for example let s say you knock a white billiard ball into a second red one that ssitting on the table and they hit each other in just the right way for this to be a true elastic collision all of the kinetic energy from the white ballwould be transferred to the red ball meaning after they hit each other the white ball would stay put and the red one wouldzoom away with all of the kinetic energy -- so the same speed basically -- that the white ball used to have but you won t come across elastic collisions in real life because there s always going to be some energy that s lost somewhere in a collision generally as heat or sound and when kinetic energy isn t conserved that s an inelastic collision there s one thing that s going to be true about every collision though whether or not it s elastic the momentum of the system will always be conserved it might be transferred to another object -- it might even be transferred to more than one object --but the momentum is always going to go somewhere and we ll be able to use math to figure out where it went and we can use what we know about impulse -- and newton s third law -- to prove it the third law of course is the one that says that every action has an equal and opposite reaction and that applies to collisions in the sense that if a ball hits a wall it ll exert a forceon the wall and the wall will exert an equally strong force on the ball we can describe each of these forces as impulses since we know that an impulse is justa change in an object s momentum so the ball s momentum will be decreasing when it hits the wall but because of newton sthird law we know that the wall s momentum is going to increase by an equal amount the change in the wall s momentum might be impossible for us to see because the wallis connected to the ground and earth has lots of mass but it s there and that fact -- that momentum is always conserved -- turns out to be super helpful for describing collisions using math like in the case where you knocked the white billiard ball into the red one since momentum is conserved and momentum is mass times velocity the white ball smass-times-velocity before the collision has to be equal to its mass-times-velocity plusthe red ball s mass-times-velocity after the collision which is why -- assuming the balls have the same mass -- if the white ball stops movingafter the collision then the red ball must move with the same velocity that the white ball had so now we know about both elastic and inelastic collisions but there s also such a thing as a perfectly inelastic collision because of course there is and it s easier for me to tell you first what it isn t so it is not a collision where the objects lose all of their kinetic energy instead a perfectly inelastic collision is what happens when objects stick together these collisions lose as much kinetic energy as possible to other forms of energy likeheat sound or even potential energy but still their momentum is conserved an example would be if you pushed one magnet toward another -- at just the right anglefor them to stick together on contact -- and then they both started sliding together athalf the speed of the magnet you pushed before the collision the momentum of one magnet was zero and the momentum of the oneyou pushed was its mass times its velocity once the magnets collide the mass is doubled and the velocity is cut in half so the total momentum stays the same but you lose some kinetic energy because there s less speed involved so that s the basics of how collisions work and how they relate to the momentum of motion in a straight line but there s one more detail we have to explore in order to really understand how objects move whether they re going to collide or not and that is center of mass until now we ve been talking about objects as though they were little point-particles and that s worked fine -- for the most part the objects we ve been talking about would act much like a small dot would but of course not all objects work that way if you ve ever tried to fling a hammer for example -- which i do not recommend doing -- it wouldn t fly through the air the same way a softball would because the hammer s mass isn t distributed evenly likewise a pendulum with a big ball on the end of a very light string -- called simple pendulum --would behave very differently from a pendulum that uses a heavier stick -- what s known as a physical pendulum in these situations it s more useful to describe what the center of mass is doing when you throw the hammer for example it ll rotate around its center of mass so what is the center of mass it s basically the average position of all the mass in the system say you have a meter long stick -- which we ll pretend is massless -- with a -kilogram ball stuck on either end it s easy to see where the center of mass should be -- the mass is distributed symmetrically so its center is going to be right in the middle of the stick now let s say you have another meter stick and on the left side there s a kilogram ball but on the right side there s a kilogram ball this time there s twice the mass on the right side of the stick so when you re trying to calculate the average position of all the mass attached to the stick you re going to be counting the right-hand side twice as much that means the center of mass will be two thirds of the way along the stick closer to the kilogram ball it s like each piece of mass pulls on the center of mass a little bit so parts withmore mass end up pulling harder and moving it closer but if you don t want to calculate this in your head -- and if there are like sevendifferent particles to deal with you probably won t -- but there s an equation for it first pick a starting point to measure from where x that can be the end of the stick the middle of the stick whatever s easiest as long as you re consistent then the center of mass will be equal to the sum of each individual mass times itsdistance from the starting point all divided by the total mass in the system let s try it for our stick with the differently-weighted balls we ll choose the left side of the stick where the kilogram ball is as our starting point the kilogram ball s mass times its position is zero the kilogram ball s mass times its position -- meters -- is kilogram-meters and the total mass of the system is kilograms so divide kilogram-meters by kilograms and you get meters that s the position of the center of mass which is two thirds of the way along the stick toward the kilogram ball s side exactly what we figured out earlier i m telling you all of this now because from here we re heading off in a totally new direction literally but for now you learned about collisions and how momentum and impulse can be used to describe them we also talked about the differences between elastic and inelastic collisions and how to calculate the center of mass of a system

crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'at this point we ve covered a lot of the basics when it comes to how things move but we ve mostly been focusing on only one type of motion translational motion which is when something moves through space but doesn t rotate but rotational motion is also a thing -- and an important one for example the spin of a football -- both the soccer and the non-soccer kind --will affect the way it flies through the air but the physics of rotational motion isn t all that different from the physics of translational motion it still involves things like position velocity and acceleration and many of the equations you use to describe rotational motion will look really familiar to you but there are some important differences like instead of positions there are angles and instead of points on a line you follow points along an arc and there are times when rotational motion can explain things that sound impossible but actually are true like when a point on a spinning wheel is actually standing still so the rules here are the same but rotational motion has what you might call its own circular logic theme music when it comes to translational motion we tend to talk about position in terms of x and y where is this object horizontally and where is it vertically those axes make sense because we re usually tracking the object s motion along those directions but for rotational motion we really want to know the object s angle -- what we call theta say we have a big disk with a dot painted on it if we call the top of the disk our starting point then when the dot is at the top its angle would be zero and when the dot is at the left its angle would be degrees -- half of a full circle but even though we ve been measuring angles using degrees until now there s anotherunit that physicists use a lot and it ll be the main one we ll use in this episode and the next that unit is called the radian and its name comes from the fact that it s based on the radius of a circle if you think back to basic geometry you ll recall that the circumference of a circleis just times pi times the circle s radius right radians describe angles by essentially telling you how much of that circumference is covered by a given angle so degrees -- which is a full circle s worth of angles -- would be pi radians degrees -- or half a circle s worth of angles -- would be pi radians and to convert any number of degrees to radians you just multiply the degrees times pi and divide by so now we know how to describe the angle of something that s rotating but what about the velocity of its rotation well we ve already learned that plain old translational or linear velocity is a measure of an object s change in position and in the same way rotational velocity is a measure of an object s change in angle this is known as its angular velocity and is represented by the lowercase greek letter omega which i want to point out looks a bit like a w but itsn t a w and as you might have guessed by now angular velocity is the derivative -- or the rateof change -- of angular displacement with respect to time but we can also describe an object s rotation in terms of its tangential velocity this is the same type of velocity we used when we talked about the physics of uniform circular motion remember with the key spinning around on a string and that vomit-causing carnival ride in those cases we described how when an object moves along a circular path its velocityis perpendicular to the radius of the circle in the direction of the motion and when you think about it any rigid object rotating around a fixed axis is basicallya set of points all moving along circular paths so at any given moment each of those points will have a tangential velocity that dependson the path it moves through -- specifically the radius of that path in fact its tangential velocity will be equal to its angular velocity times the radius it s easy to see why this makes sense if you picture the spokes of a rotating wheel all of the points along each spoke have to have the same angular velocity because theyall cover the same angular distance in the same amount of time but to get from say the right-hand side of the circle to the bottom the points onthe outside of the wheel will pass through a much bigger arc -- covering more space basically -- than the points on the inside so the farther that a point on the spoke is from the center of the wheel the greaterits tangential velocity has to be like circular motion rotational motion can also be periodic -- when the rotation repeatsafter a set amount of time which is represented by a capital t also called the period and the equations that describe periodic motion are pretty much the same as the ones we usedfor a single point moving along a circular path so the frequency or number of rotations that happen every second is equal to one divided by the period but frequency and angular velocity are really just two different ways of describing thesame thing -- they just use different units frequency is measured in rotations -- or revolutions -- per second and angular velocity is measuredin radians per second and one revolution is equal to the circumference of the circle pi radians so in order to convert from frequency to angular velocity all you need to do is multiplythe frequency by pi now there s a special case when it comes to the velocity of rotating objects and that swhat s known as rolling without slipping this kind of motion shows up in real life all the time it s what happens to your car s tires when you drive down the street as long asyou aren t skidding -- which let s hope you aren t and it s what a train s wheels do as they move along the track but it turns out that the translational velocity at the bottom of the wheel is super weird mainly because at any given moment the point at the bottom of the wheel doesn t have a translational velocity in other words it doesn t actually move to figure out why let s experiment with a bicycle wheel if you roll the wheel along the floor for one full rotation that means that the entirecircumference of the wheel will touch the floor one point at a time and the center of the wheel will move forward by a distance that s equal to the circumferenceof the wheel -- aka its radius times pi and the time it took to move that distance was equal to the period of the motion so the translational velocity of the center was equal to the radius times the angular velocity now what about the top of the wheel it has the same translational velocity as the center of the wheel plus the tangentialvelocity that comes from the wheel s rotation because at the top of the wheel the tangentialvelocity is pointing in the direction the wheel is rolling in and in the same way the bottom of the wheel has the same translational velocity as thecenter of the wheel minus the tangential velocity that comes from the wheel s rotation because at the bottom of the wheel the tangential velocity is pointing opposite to the direction the wheel is rolling in here s the weird part we just saw that the translational velocity of the wheel is equal to the radius times the angular velocity and we know that in general the magnitude of tangential velocity is also equal tothe radius times the angular velocity so the top of the wheel will be moving exactly twice as fast as the center of the wheel relative to the ground because to get its total velocity you add the translational velocity to the tangential velocity but the bottom of the wheel won t be moving at all because its total velocity isits translational velocity minus the tangential since they re moving in opposite directions as a result the total velocity at the bottom of the wheel is zero even though the wheel is clearly moving relative to the ground but if you look at the wheel s motion at any given instant you ll see that whateverpoint is at the bottom of the wheel can t be moving relative to the ground if it was moving relative to the ground that would be what we call slipping like when a car is skidding on an icy ground the wheel isn t turning but the bottomof the wheel is moving in relation to the ground because it s sliding along on top of it but this wheel isn t slipping -- its bottom has a total velocity of zero because its velocities cancel out ok i know i just blew your mind so while you put your head back together i want totalk about one more basic quality of rotational motion angular acceleration based on what you already know about acceleration you can already guess that angular accelerationis the derivative of angular velocity it s represented by the lowercase greek letter alpha and it describes how an object sangular velocity is changing over time and as an object rotates each point on it can actually accelerate in two different ways radial acceleration is another term for what we ve been calling centripetal acceleration up until now it s the acceleration inward of any point on our rotating object and it s equal tothe angular velocity squared times the radius but there s also tangential acceleration which describes whether an individual point on a rotating objectis speeding up or slowing down so like linear velocity tangential acceleration depends on the distance between the pointand the center of the object more specifically it s equal to the angular acceleration times the radius so you see angular position velocity and acceleration relate to each other in muchthe same ways that linear position velocity and acceleration do this allows us to talk about rotational motion with terms and equations that are familiarto us once we ve gotten the basics of translational motion under our belts next time we ll see how how the logic of rotational motion applies to another idea momentum for now you learned about the qualities of rotational motion including angular position angular velocity periodic motion and the special case of rolling without slipping we also talked about angular acceleration as well as constant angular acceleration crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head overto their channel to check out amazing shows like it s okay to be

is thought cafe ', 'you have a box a ring and a marble and they re all at the top of a ramp because you know how physics loves ramps especially hypothetical ramps so let s say this ramp would allow for static friction but not kinetic friction now you let go of all of these objects at the same time so that the box starts sliding and the ring and marble start rolling all at once so which of them will hit the bottom first the answer might not be what you d expect i mean we already know that when you drop two objects from the same height -- in a vacuumat least -- they ll hit the ground at the same time even if you tried it with a feather and a bowling ball so you might think that all of the objects would get to the bottom of the ramp at the same time but they won t the reason has to do with how energy is distributed in an object when it s rolling and in order to understand who wins the ramp-race and why we have to investigate some qualities of rotational motion specifically torque and the moment of inertia theme music have you ever tightened a bolt with a wrench or pulled a door open me too when we do those things the wrench and the door s handle do their jobs using torque that is they apply a force perpendicular to the axis of rotation which makes the bolt turn and door swing open that s what torque does -- it makes things rotate faster or slower in other words torque changes an object s angular velocity for the first few weeks of this course we described net forces as changing an object s linear velocity how fast it moves through space and in what direction torque essentially does the same thing but for rotational motion this means that a lot of the relationships and equations that apply to forces will apply to torque in a similar way but first let s talk about how to calculate torque by analyzing what happens when you open a door the harder you pull on the handle the more torque you ll generate and the more you ll change the door s angular velocity more net torque then means the door starts moving faster on its hinges so the strength of the force that s applied is one factor that affects torque another is the distance between the force and the axis of rotation -- or the radius a larger radius means more torque you know this if you ve ever tried opening a door with a handle that s too close to the hinge i m guessing you haven t tried that though because there s a reason doorknobsare generally placed far from the hinges a door with a handle close to the hinges would be much harder to open because you get lesstorque for the same amount of force the last factor that affects torque is the angle between the applied force and the radius if you tried to open the door by pulling the handle say parallel to the door --in the direction opposite from the hinges -- the door wouldn t move because the only part of the force that affects the door s rotation is the force that sperpendicular to the radius to put this idea in mathematical terms torque -- represented by the greek letter tau -- isequal to the perpendicular force times the radius and you know how we keep saying that for translational motion a net force on an objectis equal to its acceleration times its mass well something similar applies to rotational motion too the net torque on an object is equal to its angular acceleration times what s known as its moment of inertia now we ve talked about inertia before at least as it relates to translational motion basically it s an object s tendency to keep doing what it s been doing an object with lots of inertia is harder to speed up or slow down and in translational motion the inertia of an object depends on mass the moment of inertia works in a somewhat similar way for rotational motion but the best way to define is mathematically specifically the moment of inertia is the sum of all the individual points of mass inan object times the square of their distance from the axis of rotation so much in the same way that inertia relates to an object s mass in translational motion the moment of inertia relates to mass too but it depends on how that mass is distributed the farther away the mass is from the axis of rotation the higher the object s moment of inertia it s possible to derive the equation for an object s moment of inertia by integrating the square of the object s radius over its mass but those integrals can get complicated so this is one of those rare cases where if you re asked to solve problems usingmoments of inertia and you don t have access to the equations it s probably worth memorizing them now there s another thing that torques and forces have in common and it s going to be the key to figuring out which object wins the race down the ramp namely torques like forces have the ability to do work as you might remember from our episode on work and energy the work done by a forceis just the integral of that force over a certain distance in a similar way the work done by a torque is the integral of that torque over a certain angle meaning the more torque you apply while rotating an object the more work you do we also know that work changes the energy of a system for example it can change its kinetic energy which is the energy of its motion in the case of objects that move without rotating all of that kinetic energy goes into translational motion in this case keep in mind that -- as we ve gone over before -- the kinetic energy oftranslational motion is equal to half of the object s mass times its velocity squared but when an object is rotating some of its kinetic energy is also taking the form of rotational motion and calculating the kinetic energy of rotational motion is pretty easy because first the moment of inertia affects rotational motion in the same way that mass affects translational motion and second rotating objects have angular velocity just as translating objects have linear velocity so the kinetic energy of an object s rotational motion is just half of its moment of inertia times its angular velocity squared ok there s just one final factor we have to consider before we finally get back to the box the marble and the ring racing down the ramp and that factor is angular momentum we ve talked about linear momentum -- and how it s equal to an object s mass times its velocity well there s also angular momentum which is equal to an object s moment of inertia times its angular velocity and like linear momentum angular momentum is always conserved that s another one of those super-fundamental principles of physics you can t create or destroy angular momentum it always has to go somewhere so now let s get back to the great crash course physics ramp race all three objects -- the box the marble and the ring -- are covering the same distance and what we want to know is how fast do they cover that distance the answer has to do with what happens to each object s energy as it moves down the ramp when they re at the top of the ramp all the energy of each object takes the form of gravitational potential energy which is equal to the object s mass times small g times the height of the ramp as they move down the ramp all of that potential energy gradually gets converted into kinetic energy in the case of the box all of its potential energy will be converted to translational kinetic energy because that s the only kind of motion it has so the object that gets to the bottom of the ramp first is the box because for both the marble and the ring some of their potential energy gets converted into rotational kinetic energy and energy that goes into their rotation isn t being used to make them move faster down the ramp so really anything that slides -- at least on our hypothetical ramp with no kinetic friction-- will reach the bottom before anything that rolls and the masses of the objects don t even matter because the energy of an object withmore or less mass will increase or decrease accordingly so the box wins but what s the runner-up does the ring reach the bottom next or does the marble that question is a little more complicated but it turns out that the marble reaches the bottom before the ring because it has a lower moment of inertia the marble is a solid sphere so its mass is distributed closer to its center but the ring s mass is distributed in a well ring -- so its mass is distributed farfrom its center giving it a higher moment of inertia what does that mean for the marble s speed versus the ring s well since the marble has a smaller moment of inertia its velocity can take up a largerproportion of its kinetic energy -- which means it moves faster down the ramp so the final results of the race the box wins the marble comes in second and the ring finishes last today you learned about torque and how it relates to an object s angular accelerationand its moment of inertia we also talked about how to calculate moments of inertia angular momentum and the fact that torques can do work finally we figured out whatwould happen if you let a box marble and ring move down a ramp crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head overto their

amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'the physics we re going to talk about today has saved your life whenever you step into a building or walk across a bridge --this is the science that keeps the building standing the bridge stable and you alive it s statics -- the study of how objects behave when they are not accelerating whether that means they re standing completely still or moving at a constant velocity statics can tell you a lot about the way things behave when you re trying to balance them or when they re being compressed or stretched so engineers use statics for things like figuring out where a building s supports should go and how many of them there should be or what type of bridge design would work bestto cross that river in town you can use it too -- say the next time you climb a ladder if you do you ll find that even though an object may not be moving there are still all kinds of things affecting it like stress and strain and pressure so who knows today s episode may someday save your life theme music objects that aren t accelerating are said to be in equilibrium a concept that we ve touched on before it means that there can be forces on an object but there can t be net forces on it otherwise that net force m would make the object accelerate torque affects equilibrium too since an object in equilibrium can t have rotational acceleration either so again there can be torques on an object in equilibrium but there can t be net torques on it in other words the net torques must be equal to zero all of this means that for an object to be in equilibrium all the forces and torques on it have to balance out a classic example of forces and torques cancelling each other out is a ladder leaning against a wall the ladder isn t accelerating -- or even moving -- so it must be in equilibrium but how much force is there on the ladder from both the wall and the floor that s pretty easy to figure out let s say we know that the bottom of the ladder is m from the wall the top of theladder is m from the floor the ladder itself is m long and it has a mass of kg the first thing we gotta do is draw a free-body diagram first the force of gravity mg is pulling down on the center of the ladder and the force from the wall has only one component -- it s pushing sideways on the ladder meanwhile the force from the floor has two components one pushing up on the ladder equal and opposite to the force of gravityand one pushing on the ladder toward the wall equal and opposite to the force from the wall let s talk about the force from the wall first we don t know how strong it is but we can figure that out by thinking about the torques acting on the ladder the ladder isn t rotating so any torques on it have to add up to zero and we know from our previous lessons that torque is caused by a force applied at a distance from an axis so if we choose the point where the ladder touches the floor as our axis we can see that there are two forces applying a torque to the ladder in this case the ladder is leaning to the right to meet the wall so the force of gravityis applying a clockwise torque and the force from the wall is applying a counterclockwise torque and we know that both of those torques equal each other because the net torque on the ladder is zero the torque from gravity is equal to the ladder s weight times the perpendicular distance fromour axis to the center of the ladder -- and that s newton meters meaning that the torque from the wall is also newton meters in the opposite direction divide that by the vertical distance from where the ladder hits the wall to our axis of rotation and we get newtons the force from the wall on the ladder that s half of the problem done but what about the force on the ladder from the floor like we said there are two components of the force from the floor horizontal and vertical the horizontal component will be equal to the force from the wall -- so newtons and the vertical component will be equal to the ladder s weight -- so newtons we ve already talked about how to find the total magnitude of a force from its components-- you square the components add the results then take the square root of that number meaning that the total force from the floor on the ladder is newtons so once you know that an object s in equilibrium you can use that fact to find the forces and torques acting on it that s important because those forces can affect the object s shape -- and maybe even break it that s why one of the main questions that engineers consider is when i apply a force to this thing what will happen to it and generally whatever happens will be one of three main things first you can apply just enough force that the object will either stretch or compress but still spring back -- in that case the force is in a range known as the material s elastic zone but if you apply a little too much force the object might become permanently deformed-- meaning the force has reached what s called the plastic zone and apply way too much force and you ll get to the breaking point -- otherwise known as fracture ideally engineers want to make sure that the objects they use to build things like support beams stay within the range of option number one the elastic zone often they ll also want to know how an object s shape changes based on the amount of force that s being applied to it and the amount that an object stretches or compresses depends on a few different factors first there s the original length of the object the longer it is the more it will stretch or compress the strength of the applied force also matters more force means more stretching or compressing then there s the area of a cross-section of this object basically the thicker it is the less it will stretch or compress finally there s the type of material itself wood steel aluminum granite --they re all going to have different amounts of elasticity that s why engineers use something called young s modulus it s a number represented by a capital e that tells you how hard it is to stretch or compress a given material based on that material s stiffness the higher young s modulus is for a certain material the less elastic it is and all of these factors combine into one equation it might look kind of messy but this equation is just saying that the change in length ofsomething that s being stretched or compressed depends on its original length the force you apply its cross-sectional area and young s modulus and we can use this equation to help define a couple of terms that engineers use a lot stress and strain now these aren t the same as the feelings you get the night before a huge exam instead stress is the force on an object divided by its cross-sectional area --basically that f over a term and strain is the object s change in length divided by its original length this equation and young s modulus apply for two types of stress tensile stress which stretches objects out and compressive stress which compresses them but sometimes the forces you apply to objects aren t just compressing or stretching for example you could also apply what s known as shear stress maybe you ve done this before say there s a really thick book laying on a table -- say game of thrones or a big dictionary if you push the top of the book parallel to the table the pages will all sort of slide over each other where before you had a nice rectangular-looking book now you have more of a parallelogram the sliding happens because you re applying a force to the top of the book while the table applies an equal and opposite force to the bottom that s shear stress and the way an object deforms under shear stress depends on the same kinds of factorsthat are involved when you compress or stretch something like if the original length were longer -- meaning you had a thicker taller book that would mean more sliding more force more sliding more area perpendicular to the force -- in other words a book with bigger pages less sliding and then there s the inherent slidy-ness of the material that the object is made of which we call the shear modulus just like young s modulus the shear modulus is different for every material and is just a number represented by a capital-g the higher its shear modulus the less the object will deform put all those factors together and you get an equation that should look very familiar it s just like the equation we had before for stretching and compressing the only differences are that the original length area and change in lengthrepresent different parts of the object and that we use a different modulus but we have one last type of shape-change to consider shrinking this is what happens if you apply a force to all the parts of an object at once -- say by putting it in water the same factors affect the shape change here too the more volume the object originally had the more it ll shrink --in other words the more its volume will change when we re talking about something submerged in a fluid we give a different name to the force divided by area and instead of stress we call it pressure and the more pressure you apply to an object the more it will shrink finally some materials are more resistant to changes in volume --and that stiffness is measured by the bulk modulus represented by a capital-b combined these factors form an equation you can use to predict how much an object will shrink so now you know the three main ways that forces affect an object s shape changing its length -- through tensile and compressive stress deforming it through shear stress and changing its volume through pressure and hopefully now you also have a better understanding of all the thought that goes into making sure buildings and bridges stay up today you learned that the net force and torque on an object in equilibrium must equal zero and you saw how you can use that fact to calculate individual forces and torques we also talked about the way objects deform under tensile compressive and shear stress as well as pressure crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios

studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'this episode of crash course physics is sponsored by audible i think fluids are fascinating and awesome because they happen to be my area of expertise as an engineer in fluid dynamics but it s not just me who s intrigued by how things flow legend has it that a man once ran naked through the streets because he was so excited aboutdiscovering an important property of fluids now i ve never quite gone that far but still an understanding of fluids is incredibly useful because anything that flows -- liquid or gas -- is a fluid so water counts but so does air and so does corn syrup using their knowledge of fluids physicists and engineers can design things likepressure sensors hydraulic pumps and even airplanes but first let s start with the basics the physics of fluids at rest theme music until now we ve often described the physics of objects based on their mass but when it comes to fluids we mostly use a different quality density represented in equations by the greek letter rho you re probably familiar with density it s mass divided by volume and measured in kilograms per meters cubed if an object -- or a fluid -- is made of heavier atoms or molecules or those particles arepacked more closely together then it s going to have a higher density and there s another important quality of fluids one that scuba divers and mountain climbers think about a lot pressure in our last episode we defined pressure as applied force divided by area it s measured in units of newtons per meters squared known as pascals and fluids apply pressure in every direction so right now there s air putting pressure on you -- and me -- from every side in fact the average air pressure at sea level is thousand pascals and if you jumped in a pool the water would also exert pressure on you but if you ve ever tried diving to the bottom of a pool you ll know that there s more pressureat the bottom than at the surface -- which is why at the bottom your ears hurtand your head feels like it s about to implode that s because the deeper you go the more fluid there is above you with its weight pressing down there s an easy way to calculate the pressure of a fluid at a given depth it s just the fluid s density times small g times the distance to the surface represented by the letter h -- for height and the change in pressure based on depth is equal to the fluid s density times small g times the change in distance to the surface so let s say you re swimming in a pool that s three meters deep and you want toknow how much more pressure you ll experience at the bottom of the pool versus how deepyou are now which is let s assume a quarter of a meter the density of water is kilograms per meters cubed and the change in distance to the surface is meters which means that the pressure at the bottom of the pool is pascals more than the pressure a quarter of a meter down the water in the pool could be one example of a confined fluid because if you had apiston the size of the pool s surface and used it to push down on the water the water would have nowhere to go and back in the mid- s french physicist blaise pascal realized something about the way pressure worked in confined fluids if you apply pressure to a confined fluid the pressure in every part of the fluid increases by that amount if you have water in a cup and you use a piston to apply pascals of pressure to the surface of the water then the pressure everywhere in the water increases by pascals today that concept is known as pascal s principle and it s the reason hydraulics are so useful say you have some water in a tube with pistons on either side pascal s principle tells you that if you use the piston on the left side to apply pressure to the water the water will exert the same pressure on the piston on the right side of the tube and pressure is equal to force divided by area so say you have another tube that s more of a cone shape with a piston on the left sidethat has an area of one meter squared and one on the right that has an area of meters squaredagain you apply pascals of pressure to the piston on the left side --meaning newtons of force but the piston on the right side has double the area so for the pressures to be equal the water has to apply double the force to the pistonas you applied to the water and so you end up with newtons of force on the right-side piston this is a huge deal you re doubling the input force but you didn t have to put in any extra effort and the bigger the difference in area the more extra force you get to put it in math terms the ratio of the output force to the input force is equal tothe ratio of the output area to the input area systems like hydraulic lifts take advantage of this by having big differences in area on either side of a fluid so if you want to apply a lot of force -- to lift something heavy for example -- hydraulics are the way to go now if you re going to be using pressure to do stuff you re probably going to want to be able to measure that pressure which is where manometers and barometers come in a manometer is just a u-shaped tube with a fluid inside say you wanted to use one to measure the pressure of a bike tire you d stick one side of the tube in the tire and leaving the other side open to the atmosphere if there s a difference in the pressure on each side of the manometer whichever side has the higher pressure will push the fluid away from it --creating a difference in the height of the fluid on either side of the u in this case the inside of the bike tire has a much higher pressure than the atmosphere so the level of the fluid on the side of the u that s closer to the tire will be lower if you measured the difference in fluid height directly you d get what s known as gauge pressure --the difference between atmospheric pressure and the pressure inside the tire but the actual pressure of the tire -- the absolute pressure -- is the atmospheric pressure plus the gauge pressure so the pressure inside the tire will be equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the density of the fluid inside the manometer times small g times the difference in the heights of the fluid barometers on the other hand use a long vertical tube that s closed on one end usually filled with mercury and then stuck upside-down in a bowl that s also full of mercury with the closed end of the tube at the top the pressure of the atmosphere pushes down on the mercury in the bowl which keeps a certain amount of mercury in the tube at standard atmospheric pressure the mercury in the tube will be exactly centimeters high if the air pressure goes up so does the level of the mercury and vice versa so we have one more property to talk about when it comes to fluids at rest --and it s the one that supposedly made that guy run naked through the streets yelling eureka that guy was archimedes and he lived in greece in the third century bce legend has it that he was asked to find a way to figure out if the king s crown was pure gold and the best way to do that was to calculate its density archimedes could measure the crown s mass easily enough but he didn t know how to find its density he was taking a bath one day when he realized that the volume of the water displaced by an objectis equal to that object s volume and since he already knew the crown s mass that meant he d be able to find its volume and therefore its density just by putting it in water that s when he did the whole running-through-the-streets-naked thing so archimedes discovered that when you put something in a fluid the fluid s volume increases by the amount of the object s volume this tells us a lot about what makes objects float or sink for example say you have a tub of water and two balls of the same size but of different densities say one is an american-style billiard ball and the other s a racquetball we re going to gently place the balls in the middle of the tub let go and explain what happens to them but first let s talk about the forces acting on the water that s occupying the space where we re going to put them picture a sphere of water within the volume of water that s in the tub what are the forces acting on that watery sphere well the force of gravity is pulling it down and since the sphere is in static equilibrium there must be some force pushing up on it counteracting the force of gravity we call that force the buoyant force and it comes from the fact that the water pressureat the bottom of the sphere is greater than the pressure at the top now let s put the billiard ball where the sphere of water used to be what are the forces acting on that the force from gravity that s pulling down on the billiard ball is stronger than theforce that was pulling down on the sphere of water that s because the billiard ball is denser than water -- so even though the ball andthe sphere of water have the same size the ball is much heavier but the buoyant force on the billiard ball is exactly the same as it was on the sphereof water since they re the same shape and size that s archimedes principle there s a buoyant force pushing upward on objects in water and it s equal to the weight of the water that the object displaced the billiard ball weighs more than the sphere of water that it s replacing so there s a net downward force on the ball and it sinks to the bottom of the tub but if you were to fill in that sphere of water with a racquetball the opposite would happen in that case the force from gravity pulling it downward is weaker than the force pullingdown the sphere of water but the buoyant force pushing upward is still the same so there s a net force upward on the racquetball which is why it floats to the top of the tub some of the racquetball will pop out of the water but some of it will stay underwater-- in fact once it stops moving the racquetball will displace a volume of water that weighs exactly as much as the ball because at that point the buoyant force pushing the racquetball upward and the force of gravitypulling the racquetball downward have the same magnitude so they cancel each other out thanks to archimedes we know why objects float and sink today you learned about the properties of fluids at rest including density and pressure we also talked about pascal s principle and how it s used in hydraulics then we covered how manometers and barometers measure pressure finally we explained archimedes principle and the buoyant force this

and surprising the fact that whenever you want to shoot outside everyone decides to mow their lawn you know what else can be kind of peculiar and surprising water and in the right circumstances i could even take water that s flowing down and spurt it straight up how all of these things are possible thanks to the study of the flow of fluids known as fluid dynamics theme music by now you ve picked up on the fact that -- even though we live in the physical universe-- describing the rules of the universe sometimes requires us to pretend that certain things aren t happening like the time we rolled a bunch of stuff down a ramp and pretended that there was no kinetic friction the same is true when we talk about fluids because fluids in motion are dynamic and there are many many things going on in and around them all at once so in order to grasp the essentials of fluid dynamics let s just do some pretending shall we for one thing we re going to consider the fluids in our examples to be incompressible meaning that their densities won t change we re also going to assume that fluids flow perfectly smoothly and have no viscosity you ve probably heard of viscosity before when a fluid flows easily like water we say that it has a low viscosity fluids that don t flow as easily like honey have a higher viscosity and much like kinetic friction does in moving objects viscosity tends to complicate things in moving fluids which is why we re generally going to pretend that the fluids we re studying don t have any now say you have some water -- which exists under all of these hypothetical conditions-- in a pipe moving along smoothly this pipe narrows about halfway through so that one end is narrower than the other this shape is going to affect some of the properties of the water s flow as it passes through the narrower side of the pipe compared to the wider side but one thing that won t change is the mass of water that s moving through any given area in the pipe over time this is called the mass flow rate and it s always going to be the same everywhere in the pipe that s just because as the water flows through the pipe it pushes along the water in the rest of the pipe too so if one part of the pipe has say a kilogram of water moving through it every second the rest of the pipe also has to have a kilogram of water moving through it every second this fact that the mass flow rate at one point in the pipe will be equal to the mass flow rate at any other point is called the equation of continuity and it can tell you a lot about the relationship between the velocity of a fluidand the cross-sectional area of the pipe that it s flowing through let s say you re an engineer for the water department of hypothetical city and you need to understand the mass flow rate of hypothetical water that s going through a certain point in your underground pipe system but you don t know the mass that s going through that part of the pipe at any given moment all you know are the water s velocity and the area of the cross-section of that certain section of pipe in order to describe the mass flow rate you ll have to use what we know about density area and velocity to work some algebra magic first let s have a look at a cross section of that point of the pipe from our last lesson you know that the mass of the fluid moving past this cross-sectional area over time is equal to its density times its volume and the volume of the fluid moving past this point is simply the area of the pipe at this cross section times the distance the fluid moves and from our episodes on the physics of motion you also know that the distance the fluid moves divided by the change in time is equal to the fluid s velocity so by putting all that together you can get a different version of the equation of continuity at any given point in the pipe the density of the fluid flowing through it times the area of the pipe times the fluid s velocity will be the same as for any other point in the pipe and since you re dealing with an incompressible fluid the density is going to be the same for every point in the pipe anyway so really you ve just figured out that at any point in the pipe the area of the pipetimes the fluid s velocity will be the same as for any other point it s the same thing we said before the mass flow rate is the same for every point in the pipe but instead of putting that relationship in terms of mass and time you re putting it in terms of area and velocity and in your role as a water-department engineer this is important for you to know because it means that where the pipe is narrower the fluid will have to flow faster in order to compensate but here s a weird thing a fluid that s flowing really fast actually has less pressure than when it s flowing more slowly sure it might feel like it s exerting more force than when it flows through a wider opening but that s not what physicists mean when they talk about the pressure in a pipe they re really talking about the pressure on the walls of the pipe this means that the slower the fluid flows the more pressure it puts on the pipe itself this is known as bernoulli s principle it states that the higher a fluid s velocity is through a pipe the lower the pressure on the pipe s walls and vice versa bernoulli also came up with what we now know as bernoulli s equation it might look kind of intimidating at first but when you break it down it s actually just a way of combining a bunch of things that you ve already learned bernoulli based his equation on the concept of conservation of energy as a fluid flows through a pipe it won t gain or lose any energy this means that no matter where the fluid is in the pipe if you take all of the forms of energy that the fluid has at that point and add them up they ll equal the same number as any other point in the pipe to better understand this have a look at how the three forms of energy in a fluid are represented in bernoulli s equation first there s pressure times volume in our episode on work and energy we defined energy as the ability to do work and when a fluid applies pressure and moves the volume of fluid that s downstream it s doing work so pressure times volume must be a form of energy the first term in bernoulli s equation takes that energy and divides it by volume which just leaves pressure next a flowing fluid also has kinetic energy when we first talked about kinetic energy we said that it s equal to half of an object s mass times its velocity squared again bernoulli divided this form of energy by volume to get half the fluid s density times its velocity squared that s called the kinetic energy density and it s the second term of bernoulli s equation finally a flowing fluid also has the potential energy that comes from gravity and we ve said before that the potential energy from gravity is equal toan object s mass times small g times its height when bernoulli divided that by volume he got density times small g times height --the potential energy density and the third term of his equation why divide all these terms by volume well when it comes to fluids it s just easier to talk about things in terms of density than it is to talk about mass so when you look at his equation piece by piece you can see that bernoulli was reallyjust putting conservation of energy into a special form that would be useful for fluids now let s look at a special case of bernoulli s equation known as torricelli s theorem torricelli s theorem uses conservation of energy to find the velocity of fluid flowing from a small spout in a container and it says that the velocity of the fluid coming out of the spout is the same as thevelocity of a single droplet of fluid that falls from the height of the surface of the fluid in the container in other words the pressure that s pushing the fluid out of the spoutgives it the same velocity that it would get from the force of gravity to see this theorem in action let s say you re not a water department engineer -- you re just you and you re watering your garden with the water you ve saved up in your rain barrel your barrel doesn t have a top and you re watering your carrots and lettuce and stufffrom a hole -- or a spout -- in the side now you want to know what s the velocity of the water coming out of the spout from bernoulli s equation we know that the sum of the pressure kinetic energy density and the potential energy density of the water at the top of the cooler will equal the sumof those three qualities of the water coming out of the spout but we can simplify that relationship a bit to find the velocity of the fluid coming out first the upper surface of the water in the barrel and the water that s coming out of the spout are both exposed to the atmosphere so the pressure at those points will be the same -- it s just the atmospheric pressure so we can cross off the pressure from each side of the equation now there might be water coming out of the spout but the top of the barrel has a much bigger area so the water at the top of the barrel isn t going to be moving very much in fact we can say that its velocity is basically zero which means that the kinetic energy density for the water at the top of the barrel is zero finally we can cross out the density in each term of the equation since it s not changing we re left with a much simpler equation with only three terms --an equation that should look very familiar if you ve watched our episodes on the physics of motion it s a kinematic equation you already know the two main kinematic equations the definition of acceleration and the displacement curve and you can rearrange them to get another equation that relates displacement velocity and acceleration -- without considering time it s exactly the same equation as the one we just found by using bernoulli s equationto describe the velocity of the water coming out of the spout so torricelli s theorem tells you that if a droplet of water fell from the same height as the top of the barrel when it reached the level of the spout it d have the same velocity as the water coming out of the spout now you know how fast the water s coming out your rain barrel and how much water you re putting in your garden over a certain amount of time but you want to try something fun let s turn the spout on your barrel so it s pointing up instead of down if the water from this spout could shoot straight up the stream would get exactly as high as the water at the top of the barrel before falling down to the ground today you learned

engineering the millennium bridge-- a pedestrian bridge spanning the river thames it promised to be very useful and it was cool to look at but it had to be close almost immediately because when people used the bridge it swayed back and forth dramatically due to the force of their footsteps undeterred people kept using the bridge but as they walked they began leaning into the swaying to keep themselves from falling over and that only made things worse eventually the motion of the bridge became so severe that the bridge took on the shape of a giant s essentially a horizontal wave the bridge had to be closed and the engineers took nearly two years to fix it the problem so what was wrong with the millennium bridge and why didn t the engineers foresee the problem the answer lies in oscillations theme music the physics that caused the swaying of the millennium bridge has to do with oscillations or back-and-forth motion more specifically it has to do with simple harmonic motion where oscillations follow a particular consistent pattern but before we had the millennium bridge as a real-life example physicists often described simple harmonic motion in terms of a ball attached to a horizontal spring lying on a table while it s lying there at rest it s in equilibrium and when you move the ball so that it stretches the spring then let go the ball keeps moving back and forth forever in a frictionless world that back-and-forth motion caused by the force of the spring is simple harmonic motion now we want to know two things about this oscillating ball what kinds of energy does it have and what s its maximum velocity to better understand what s happening to the ball let s start with its energy as the ball compresses and stretches the spring both kinetic energy and potential energy come into play kinetic energy is the energy of motion and as the ball moves there are two points --the turning points -- where it s not moving one point is where the spring is compressed all the way and the other is where it s stretched all the way and the distance between either of these two points and the equilibrium point is called the amplitude at those two turning points the ball won t have any kinetic energy since it isn t moving instead all of the ball s energy will be potential energy from the spring half of the spring constant times the amplitude squared now as the ball moves toward the middle its kinetic energy starts to increase because it s moving faster and faster and at the same time its potential energy decreases keeping its total energy the same and exactly in the middle of the ball s motion -- at the equilibrium point -- its potential energy goes down to the ball is back where it started so the spring isn t pulling on it anymore its kinetic energy on the other hand has reached its maximum which means that at that point the total energy of the ball will be equal to half of its mass times its maximum velocity squared now we have two equations for the total energy in this oscillating spring which we can combine into one equation and if we use algebra to move around its variables we can start to answer the second question we had about the ball we wanted to know the ball s maximum velocity and this equation tells us that it s equalto the amplitude times the square root of the spring constant divided by its mass so we ve answered our two questions about the ball on the spring we know about its energy and we have an equation for its maximum velocity but there s a lot more going on with this ball than just its energy and velocity it also has properties like a period a frequency and an angular velocity plus its position changes with time you might recognize those terms because we ve already talked about them in our episode on uniform circular motion and that s no coincidence simple harmonic motion is actually a lot like uniform circular motion mathematically speaking you can see this for yourself if you compare the ball s motion on the spring to an object in uniform circular motion --say a marble moving along a ring at a constant speed ok i admit it might seem like kind of a weird comparison at first for one thing the ball on the spring is moving in one dimension while a marble moving along a circular path is in two dimensions but what if you take that ring and look at it from the side the marble keeps moving along its circular path but to you it looks like it s just moving back and forth along a straight line not only that but it looks like this marble is stopping momentarily as it changes direction and moving faster as it gets closer to the middle which is exactly the same way the ball was moving on the spring now let s take this comparison a step further let s assume that the radius of the ring is the same as the amplitude of the ball s motion on the spring and the marble s constant speed along the ring is equal to the maximum speed of the ball on the spring in that case if you did the math you d find that the equation for the marble s velocity-- when you look at it edge-on -- is exactly the same as the equation that describedthe velocity of the ball on the spring so let s recall what we know about uniform circular motion to see what it can tell us about simple harmonic motion we know that the time it takes for the marble to move around the ring once is called the period we also know that the period will be equal to the circumference of the ring divided by the marble s speed and the radius of the circle is the same as the ball s amplitude on the spring so its circumference will be equal to two times pi times the amplitude this means that the period will be equal to times pi times the amplitude divided by the marble s speed -- which again is the same as the ball s maximum speed as it moves on the spring and we can simplify that equation since we know that the maximum speed of the ball isequal to the amplitude times the square root of the spring constant divided by the mass so the period of the marble s motion around the ring is equal to two pi times the root of m over k now we ve also talked about the frequency of uniform circular motion it s the number of revolutions the marble makes around the ring every second and it s equal to divided by the period in this case the frequency will also be equal to over pi times the square root of k over m and that ll apply to the ball on the spring too because the rules are the same finally there s angular velocity to consider in uniform circular motion we ve described it as the number of radians per second thatthe marble covers as it moves around the ring and angular velocity is just equal to the frequency times pi which means that in the case of the ball on the spring it s equal to the square root of k over m so now with the help of our knowledge about circular motion we can understand the period frequency and angular velocity of the ball s simple harmonic motion as it oscillates on the spring but there s one more question how does the ball s position change over time to find out we ll have to analyze the marble s motion along the ring again and the answer will involve some trigonometry but it s not particularly complicated trig so it ll be fine at any given point along the marble s path it ll be at a certain angle to the right-hand side of the ring and the cosine of that angle will be equal to its horizontal distance from the center of the ring divided by the ring s radius we already know that the radius of the ring is the same as the amplitude of the ball s motion along the spring and if you turn the ring so that it looks like a line again you can see that the marble shorizontal distance from the center of the ring is the same as the ball s distance from the equilibrium point so the cosine of theta is equal to the ball s position divided by its amplitude in other words the ball s position is equal to the amplitude times the cosine of the angle and we can simplify this equation too in the same way that distance is equal to velocity multiplied by time the angle is equal to the angular velocity multiplied by time so we can write the equation for the position of the ball as x a cos w t and when you graph this equation something interesting happens it looks like a wave we ll be talking a lot more about waves in our next three episodes but for now it s helpful just to see the connection here for an object in simple harmonic motion the graph of its position versus time is a wave which is why the swaying of the millennium bridge looked like a wave speaking of the bridge now we can better understand what happened to it the bridge s shimmy was the result of oscillation but it was made worse by another culprit resonance resonance can increase the amplitude of an oscillation by applying force at just the right frequency --kind of like how you can get a kid to swing higher by pushing at just the right moment the engineers of the millennium bridge were reminded of that the hard way when pedestrians on the bridge started to lean into its swaying they created resonance they amplified the amplitude of the oscillation and the engineers of the bridge did account for oscillations caused by resonance when they designed it but they only considered vertical oscillations -- the kind that would have made the bridge bounce up and down they didn t realize that they d also have to factor in the horizontal swaying caused by people walking so it was only a tiny bit of swaying at first but it got a lot worse because people were leaning into their steps causing resonance in the end engineers had to apply a series of changes to the bridge that applied force to counteract its oscillations because if there s one thing you don t want your bridge to be doing it s the wave today you learned about simple harmonic motion -- the energy of that motion and how we can use mathof uniform circular motion to find the period frequency and angular velocity of a mass on a spring we also described how the position of an object in simple harmonic motion changes over time crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you

s ropes that can mysteriously put itself back together once it s been cut it in half and it s not particularly strong or durable but you might say that it does have special powers because it ll demonstrate for us the physics of traveling waves ropes and strings are really good for this kind of thing because when you move them back and forth the movement of your hand travels through the rope as a wave by observing what happens to this rope when we try different things with it we ll be able to see how waves behave including how those waves sometimes disappear completely how s that for a magic trick theme music this is a typical wave and waves form whenever there s a disturbance of some kind often when something about the physical world changes the information about that disturbancegradually moves outward away from the source in every direction and as the information travels it makes a wave shape think about all the disturbance you cause for example when you jump on a trampoline when you hit the trampoline the downward push that you create moves the material next to it down a little bit too and the same goes for the material next to that and so on and while that information is traveling outward the spot where your feet first hit the trampolineis already recovering moving upward again because of the tension force in the trampoline and that moves the area next to it upward too this up-and-down motion gradually ripples outward covering more and more of the trampoline and the ripples take the shape of a wave waves are made up of peaks with crests -- the bumps on top -- and troughs -- the bumps on the bottom they have an amplitude which is the distance from the peaks to the middle of the wave they also have a wavelength which is the distance between crests -- a full cycle of the wave --and a frequency which is how many of those cycles pass through a given point every second multiply the wavelength by the frequency and you get the wave s speed -- how fast it s going and the wave s speed only depends on the medium it s traveling through that s why the speed of sound -- which is a wave -- doesn t depend on the sound itself it doesn t matter how loud or quiet it is it just depends on whether the sound is traveling through say air or water now there are four main kinds of waves and we can use our rope to show the difference between some of them a pulse wave is what happens when you move the end of the rope back and forth just one time one lonely crest travels through the rope -- that s the pulse then there s a continuous wave which is what happens when you keep moving the rope back and forth in that case your hand is acting as an oscillator anything that causes an oscillation or vibration can create a continuous wave now things that cause simple harmonic oscillation move in such a way that they create sinusoidal waves --meaning that if you plotted the waves on a graph they d look a lot like the graph of sin x but the waves we ve mainly been talking about so far are transverse waves --ones in which the oscillation is perpendicular to the direction that the wave is traveling in when a wave travels along this rope for example the peaks are perpendicular to the rope s length the same thing was mostly true for the waves that you made on the trampoline the waves were traveling along its surface horizontally but the peaks were vertical but there are also longitudinal waves where the oscillations happen in the same direction as the wave is moving in the case of a longitudinal wave the back-and-forth motion is more of a compression-and-expansion these are the kinds of waves that you get by compressing and stretching a spring --and they re also the kinds by which sound travels which we ll talk more about next time but all waves -- no matter what kind they are -- have something in common they transport energy as they travel at a microscopic level waves occur when the movement of one particle affects the particle next to it and to make that next particle start moving there has to be an energy transfer but how can you tell how much energy a wave has well remember that an object in simple harmonic motion has a total energy of one-half times the spring constant times the amplitude of the motion squared which means for a wave caused by simple harmonic motion every particle in the wave will also have that same total energy of half k a squared all of this together tells us that a wave s energy is proportional to its amplitude squared in other words if you double the wave s amplitude you get four times the energy triple the amplitude you get nine times the energy so why is the relationship between amplitude and energy transport so important well the intensity of a wave is related to the energy it transports more specifically its intensity is equal to its power divided by the area it s spread over and power is energy over time so changing the amplitude of a wave can change its energy -- and therefore its intensity-- by the square of the change in amplitude and this relationship is extremely important for things like figuring out how much damagecan be caused by the shockwaves from an earthquake but waves also get weaker as they spread out because they re distributed over more area a spherical wave for example -- one that ripples outward in all directions --will be spread over the surface area of a sphere that gets bigger and bigger the farther the wave travels the surface area of a sphere is equal to times pi times its radius squared so as a spherical wave moves farther from its source its intensity will decrease by the square of the distance from it two meters away from the source and the intensity of the wave will be times less than if you were meter away three meters away and it ll be times less that s why being just a little bit farther away from the source of an earthquake can sometimes make a huge difference now let s go back to the waves we were making with the rope suppose you attach one end of the rope to a ring that s free to move up and down on a rod then with your hand you send a pulse -- in the form of a crest rippling along it when the pulse gets to the end of the rope the rope slides along the rod but then it slides back to where it was that motion -- the sliding back -- reflects the wave back along the rope again as a crest but something totally different happens if you attach the end of the rope so it s fixed and can t move now if you send a pulse along the rope it will still be reflected -- but this time as a trough the wave was inverted that s because when the pulse reached the fixed end of the rope it was trying to slide the end of the rope upward but it couldn t because the end of the rope was fixed so instead the rope got yanked downward and the momentum from that downward movement carried the rope below the fixed end inverting the wave now sometimes multiple waves can combine for example say you send two identical pulses -- both crests -- along a rope one from each end when the two pulses overlap they ll combine to make one crest with a higher amplitude than the original ones that s called constructive interference -- the waves build on each other now let s say you do the same thing again this time both waves have the same amplitude but one s a crest and the other is a trough and when they overlap the rope will be flat it looks like the waves just disappeared that s called destructive interference when waves cancel each other out constructive and destructive interference happen with all kinds of waves --pulse or continuous transverse or longitudinal and sometimes we can use the effects to our advantage noise-canceling headphones for example work by analyzing the noise around you and generatinga sound wave that destructively interferes with the sound waves from that noise canceling it out there s a lot more to talk about when it comes to the physics of sound but we ll save that for next time today you learned about traveling waves and how their frequency wavelength and speed are all connected we also talked about different types of waves including pulse continuous transverse andlongitudinal waves and how they all transport energy finally we discussed reflection and interference crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head over to

ocean or the onesyou made when you jumped on that trampoline last time those waves produce ripples that run perpendicular to the direction that the wave is traveling in but sound is the other kind of wave it s a longitudinal wave meaning that the wave sback-and-forth motion happens in the same direction in which the wave travels say you get a text message on your phone and it makes a nice bright little ding sound what actually happened like on a physical level your phone s speaker contains a diaphragm -- a piece of stiff material usually in theshape of a cone when you got the message the electronics inside the speaker made the diaphragm moveback and forth which vibrated the air around your phone that made the atoms and molecules in the air move back and forth then those moving particles vibrated the air around them -- and as the process continued the sound wave spread outward ding sorry i m just gonna turn this off now anyway physicists sometimes describe sound waves in terms of the movement of these particlesin the air -- in what s known as a displacement wave but by moving particles in the air sound waves also do something else they cause the air to compress and expand -- which is why sound waves are sometimesdescribed as pressure waves as the wave spreads through the air the particles end up bunching together in some places and spreading out in others together all that bunching and spreading-out causes areas of high pressure and low pressureto form and move through the air it s useful to describe sound waves as pressure waves because we can build devices that detectthose changes in pressure that s how some microphones work for example they use a diaphragm stretched over a sealedcompartment and as sound waves pass by they create areas of lower or higher pressure inthe compartment the differences in pressure cause the diaphragm to move back and forth which electronicsthen translate into audio dataand your eardrums basically work the same way as pressure waves pass through they make your eardrum vibrate your brain then interprets those vibrations as sound but not all sounds are the same even before we knew much about physics humans were describing sound in terms of certain qualities mainly by things like loudness and pitch our understanding of those qualities helped shape the development of music -- which we lltalk more about next time but there s also a more physics-y side to those qualities of music pitch can be high or low and it corresponds to the frequency of the wave so air that s vibrating back and forth more times per second will have a higher pitch and air that s vibrating fewer times per second will have a lower pitch humans hear sounds best when the vibrations are somewhere between per second on thelow end and per second on the high end as we get older and lose more of the cells that help us detect sound we start to losethe ability to hear higher-pitched sounds some building security companies will take advantage of this using devices that emita high-pitched noise that most people over the age of can t hear the idea is that since kids and teens can hear it and it s super annoying to them they won t hang out near the building but some sounds are too high or low for any humans to hear sounds that are too high in pitch are called ultrasonic and sounds that are too low arecalled infrasonic dog whistles for example use an ultrasonic pitch that s too high for us but is perfectlyaudible to dogs elephants on the other hand use infrasonic sound to communicate with each other acrosslong distances they can hear these calls from several kilometers away but we can t hear them at all another aspect that shapes sound is its loudness -- when you increase the intensity of a sound you increase its loudness and vice versa we ve talked about the intensity of a wave before it s the wave s power over itsarea measured in watts per square meter we ve also said that the intensity of a wave is proportional to the wave s amplitude squared and the farther you are from the source of a wave the lower its intensity -- by thesquare of the distance between you and the source and just as there s a range of pitches that humans can hear there s also a range ofsound wave intensity that humans can comfortably hear generally people can safely hear sounds from about picowatt per square meter up to watt per square meter -- which is about as loud as a rock concert if you re near the speakers the sound waves coming from a jet plane that s meters away for example probably hasan intensity of around watts per square meter now i don t know if you ve ever been that close to a roaring jet plane but there s a reason people who work on the tarmac at airports use those heavy-duty headphones below picowatt per square meter sounds are just too soft for us to detect them and although we will hear sounds above a watt per square meter they tend to hurt our ears but here s a weird thing about loudness and intensity it s not a linear relationship generally a sound wave needs to have ten times the intensity to sound twice as loud to us this relationship holds true as long as the sound is toward the middle of the range offrequencies we can hear so instead of directly measuring the loudness of sounds by their intensity we use unitscalled decibels -- which are based on bels bels convert a sound wave s intensity to a logarithmic scale where every notchon the scale is ten times higher than the previous one the scale starts off with an intensity of picowatt per square meter correspondingto bels so a sound that s bel is ten times as intense as a sound that s bels and a sound that s bels is times as intense as a sound that s bel ---- but times as intense as a sound that s bels measuring everything in bels can be kind of annoying because sometimes you want to talkabout sounds that are say bels without having to deal with decimal points that s why most of the time you ll hear the loudness of a sound described using themore familiar decibel unit -- a tenth of a bel to find the loudness of a sound when you know its intensity you take the base- logarithmof its intensity over the reference intensity of picowatt per square meter then you multiply that number by to get the sound s decibel level we can use this equation to convert the intensity of that noisy rock concert -- which we saidwas watt per square meter -- to decibels first we take the base log of watt per square meter over picowatt per square meter now divided by x - is just x so what we really want to do is take the base log of x -- or a trillion -- wattsper square meter what a logarithm asks you to do is find the power that you would need to raise the baseto in order to get the number in parentheses in other words we re looking for the exponent of that would equal x which is just to finish off the calculation of decibels from intensity we multiply that value -- -- by to get the decibel level of the rock concert where you were standing decibels ouch you ll notice that as the source of a sound moves closer to you it gets louder and asit moves away it gets softer that makes sense since the closer you are to the source of a sound the greater theintensity of the wave that hits your ear but have you ever noticed that the pitch of the sound changes too it s called the doppler effect as a source of sound moves toward you the pitchof the sound you hear increases and as the source moves away the pitch decreases to see why imagine you re standing on the sidewalk when suddenly you hear an ambulancesiren start up it s coming from down the road and it seems to be moving toward you the ambulance is continuously emitting sound waves at a certain frequency in the formof that siren but as the ambulance moves toward you the ambulance is also driving toward those sound waves so the peaks that hit your eardrums are closer together -- even though they re moving atthe same speed -- and you get hit by them more often which means you hear a higher-pitched sound at the same time it keeps emitting more sound which adds more peaks to those earlier soundwaves that are heading your way what you end up with is a sound wave with a higher frequency than before that s what hits your eardrum so you hear a sound that s higher in pitch than theone you heard before the ambulance started moving as the ambulance passes you and starts to drive away down the road the opposite happens the sound waves are still coming toward you but the ambulance is driving away from them so the peaks that hit your eardrum are farther apart and you hear a sound with a lower pitch the doppler effect isn t unique to sound waves though -- it happens with light too which means we can actually use it to measure the distance of stars -- but more on that much later for now you learned about sound waves and how they move particles back and forth tocreate differences in pressure we also talked about pitch and how the intensity of a sound wave changes with amplitude and distance finally we covered decibels as well as the doppler effect crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios

course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', ' flute plays crash course theme that s a familiar tune how do instruments like this guitar create music we ve talked about the science of sound and some of the properties of sound waves but when we talk about sound waves in the context of music there are all kinds of fascinating properties and weird rules to talk about i m talking about the music that comes from string wind and brass instruments string instruments create sound when their strings vibrate in the air and in order to understand how these instruments work you have to realize that making music is not just an art it s also a science theme music sound you ll recall is a wave a longitudinal wave this means that the medium that the wave travels through oscillates -- or moves back and forth-- in the same direction that the wave is moving but string wind and brass instruments use a special kind of wave they re standing waves a standing wave is a wave that looks like it isn t moving its amplitude may change but it isn t traveling anywhere standing waves are the result of two other things waves do both of which we ve talked about before reflection and interference reflection is what happens when a wave reaches the end of a path and then moves back along the same path that s what happens when you send a pulse down a rope -- it reaches the end and then comes right back when we send a continuous wave down the rope that s when interference comes into play the wave reaches the end of the rope and is reflected but there are more peaks on the way as the peaks pass each other they interfere with one another changing their sizes usually you end up with crests and troughs that are different sizes and various distances apart but at certain frequencies the reflected waves interfere in such a way that you end upwith a wave that seems to stay perfectly still with only its amplitude changing that s a standing wave and it can happen both in strings and in the air in pipes and that s what makes music standing waves with different frequencies correspond to different musical notes now in order to understand how standing waves operate you should get to know their anatomy the points of a standing wave that don t oscillate are called nodes and the points at the maximum height of the peaks are antinodes and here s something cool if you look at a string on a stringed instrument you can actually see where the nodes and antinodes are the standing wave creates peaks along the string and between those peaks there are points that just stay still so the peaks are the antinodes and the points that don t oscillate are nodes and if one or both of the string s ends are fixed then each fixed end is a node too because it s stuck in place now in a pipe the standing waves are made of air molecules moving back and forth but the areas where molecules oscillate the most including those near any open ends of the pipe form the peaks and therefore the antinodes and between those peaks as well as at any closed ends of the pipe are areas where molecules don t move at all those are the nodes generally musicians make their music using the frequencies of these standing waves but the nature of these waves depends a lot on what the ends of the string or pipe look like remember how a wave traveling down a rope gets reflected differently depending on whether the end of the rope is fixed or loose a fixed end will invert the wave -- turning crests into troughs and vice versa --while a loose end will just reflect it without inverting it the same thing holds true for air in a pipe a closed end will invert the wave while an open end won t so the properties of a standing wave will be a little different depending on whether it s made with a string with two fixed ends or a pipe with two ends open or a string or a pipe with one end fixed and the other open a string with two fixed ends -- like in a piano -- is probably the simplest way to understand standing waves because we know that no matter what the wave made by a fixed string will have at least two nodes -- one at each end and in its most basic form it would have just one antinode in the middle so the wave is basically a peak that moves from being a crest to a trough and vice versalike some kind of one-dimensional jump rope this most basic kind of standing wave is known as the fundamental -- or the st harmonic it s the simplest possible standing wave you can have with the fewest nodes and antinodes there are other more complex standing waves that you can have too these are known as overtones overtones build on the fundamental incrementally each overtone adds a node and an antinode so each of these overtones is related to the fundamental wave -- and all of the overtones are related to each other together the fundamental wave and the overtones make up what are known as harmonics the fundamental is the st harmonic and the overtones are higher-numbered harmonics with each node-and-antinode pair that s added to the standing wave the number of the harmonic goes up nd harmonic rd harmonic and so on now physicists sometimes express harmonics in terms of wavelength for example for a string with two fixed ends you ll notice that the fundamental covers exactly half a wavelength a full wavelength of the wave would span two peaks a crest and a trough but the fundamental spans exactly one peak which is half the wavelength so for the fundamental of a string with two fixed ends the length of the string is equal to half a wavelength the second-simplest standing wave you can have on a string with two fixed ends has nodes --one at each end and one in the middle -- plus antinodes in between the nodes it s called the nd harmonic and the string holds exactly one wavelength you can probably guess what the rd harmonic looks like it has nodes and antinodes and the string holds -- or -- wavelengths you may have started to notice a pattern for a standing wave on a given length of string the number of wavelengths that fit on the string is equal to the number of the harmonic divided by so now we have an equation that relates the wavelength of a standing wave to the number of the harmonic and the length of the string once you get a handle on wavelength you can figure out the aspect of the wave that musicians care about most -- the frequency we ve already established that a wave s wavelength times its frequency is equal to its velocity which will be the same for each harmonic because a wave s velocity only depends on the medium it s traveling through so a standing wave s frequency will be equal to its velocity divided by its wavelength for the fundamental with two fixed ends we already know that the wavelength is twice the string s length so the frequency of that fundamental standing wave -- known as the fundamental frequency-- is equal to the velocity divided by twice the length of the string we write it as f with a subscript of now what about the frequency of the second harmonic -- the standing wave with nodes and antinodes it will be equal to the velocity divided by the length of the string which is twice the fundamental frequency and the frequency of the third harmonic with its nodes and antinodes will be equal to three times the fundamental frequency so we re starting to see another pattern here the frequency of a standing wave with two fixed ends will just be equal to the number of the harmonic times the fundamental frequency in fact that s one way to define harmonics the number of a harmonic is equal to the number you multiply by the fundamental frequency to get the harmonic s frequency this math is what makes musical instruments work when you press down a key on a piano you make a hammer strike a string creating standing waves in that string every string in the piano is tuned so that its fundamental frequency --which depends on the string s mass length and tension -- corresponds to a given note middle c for example is hz guitars are also tuned so that the fundamental frequencies of their strings correspond to set notes and when you press down on the strings in certain places you change the length of the active part of string so that its fundamental frequency corresponds to a different note so for a standing wave with two fixed ends we can relate wavelength frequency velocity the length of the string and the number of the harmonic and we can do the exact same thing for a standing wave with two loose ends -- in an open pipe for example like in a flute a standing wave in a pipe with two open ends is kind of the opposite of the wave with two fixed ends instead of having a node at each end it has an antinode at each end so the fundamental standing wave for a pipe with two open ends will have two antinodes and one node in the middle of the wave then the nd harmonic will have three antinodes and two nodes and so on but each harmonic still covers the same number of wavelengths remember how the fundamental wave for a string with two fixed ends covered half of a wavelength the fundamental wave for a pipe with two open ends also covers half of a wavelength that half is just in a different section of the wave and just like a string with two fixed ends the second harmonic for a pipe with two open ends also covers a full wavelength it s just that in the case of the pipe the wave starts and ends with a peak instead of a node so the equations for wavelength and frequency for a standing wave with two open endswill be the same as they were for a standing wave with two fixed ends so we ve covered guitars and pianos and flutes but a pipe with one closed end and one open end works a little differently these kinds of pipes are used in instruments like pan flutes where you blow across the top of a closed pipe to make music here standing waves need a separate set of equations for a couple of reasons first the closed end of the pipe will be a node because the air molecules aren t oscillating there and the open end will be an antinode because that s where there s a peak in the oscillations which means that the simplest wave you can make in this pipe will stretch from one node to one peak but that s only a span of a quarter of a wavelength in the pipe before with both a string fixed at both ends and an open pipe the fundamental spanned half a wavelength the fact that a pan-flute pipe only covers a quarter of a wavelength changes things because remember the frequency of each harmonic is equal to the number of the harmonic times the fundamental frequency but for a pipe that s closed on one end you can t double the fundamental frequency or quadruple it -- or multiply it by any even number because it would result in a wave that would need a node on both ends or a peak on both ends which isn t possible so a pipe that s closed on one end can t have even-numbered harmonics all of this helps explain why musical instruments sound different even when they re playing the same note when you play a note you re creating the fundamental wave plus some of the other harmonics -- the overtones and for each instrument different harmonics will have different amplitudes -- and therefore sound louder but because of the physics of standing waves instruments that have pipes with one closed endwon t create the even-numbered harmonics at all that s why a c on the flute sounds so different from a c on say the bassoon today you learned about standing waves and how they re made up of nodes and antinodes we discussed harmonics and how to find the frequency of a standing wave on a string withtwo fixed ends a pipe with two open ends and a pipe with one closed end finally we explained why a pipe with one closed end can t have even-numbered harmonics crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head over to their channel and check out a playlist of the latest

our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'this episode of crash course physics is sponsored by audible have you ever taken a good look at your nearest bridge we already know what can happen to a bridge if you don t consider all the variables before you build one but what about the ones that work just fine like the ones you cross every day like on your commute if you ve ever stopped to take a look you might notice that there are cracks in the concrete these cracks are a few centimeters thick and they contain what looks like some kind of metal grating the cracks and grating are there for a reason they re called expansion joints and without them the bridges would probably have failed a long time ago if there are bridges in your town they probably have expansion joints too so why are these ugly metal cracks necessary the answer has to do with thermodynamics the study of temperature and how it affects matter theme music so what is temperature anyway at the most basic level temperature is a measure of how much kinetic energy -- that is the energy of motion -- is in a system the hotter something is the higher its temperature it has more kinetic energy because its atoms and molecules are moving around more and the easiest way to figure out if there s a temperature difference between two systems is through heat transfer the hotter system will always transfer heat to the colder one and if there s no heat transfer between systems at all that s called thermal equilibrium but usually there will be some heat transfer because that s how the temperature of a system changes and when the temperature of an object changes it can undergo what s known as thermal expansion usually an increase in temperature will make a solid expand and a decrease in temperature will make it contract now there are two main ways that the dimensions of a solid can change based on a change in temperature it can increase or decrease in length or it can increase or decrease in volume these changes in length and volume work in a very similar way to the changes in length and volume from stress and strain that we talked about in our episode on statics in the case of a bridge the change is in its length -- what s known as linear expansion and the equation that we use to describe linear expansion says that the change in length is equal to what s known as the coefficient of linear expansionx the initial length x the change in temperatureso let s break down that equation to see how it works the longer the bridge is to start with the more it will expand or contract and the greater the temperature change the more it will also expand or contract the only other thing that the change in length depends on is that coefficient of linear expansion represented by the greek letter alpha the value for that coefficient depends on the material and the higher the coefficient is the more the length of the material will change in response to a change in temperature and that s why bridges have expansion joints to give the concrete room to expand when it s warmer outside and contract back down in cooler weather without expansion joints the concrete would experience much more stress and you d be much more likely to end up with a broken bridge and the same principles apply to other kinds of expansion volume expansion is just like linear expansion except that the change happens in all three dimensions the equation for volume expansion just says that the change in volume isequal to the coefficient of volume expansion times the initial volume times the change in temperature as with linear expansion the bigger the object is in the first place the more it ll expand or contract and a greater temperature change will lead to a greater change in volume finally the volume change depends on how much of a tendency any particular material has to expand or contract that s its coefficient of volume expansion -- represented by the greek letter beta but changes in temperature don t only affect solids they also affect gases and in gases temperature has a direct bearing on the pressure volume and amount of the gas all four of those properties are related to one another if you ve taken a chemistry course like maybe the one hank hosted you re probably already familiar with the concept of an ideal gas a hypothetical gas that obeys a certain set of rules which lets you describe it more simply so what are these rules well an ideal gas is made up of lots of molecules that move around randomly as they re zooming around those molecules might collide and bounce off one another but they ll exert no other forces on each other outside of these collisions and the volume of all the gas molecules combined is very small compared to the volume of the container and in many cases a real gas is close enough to an ideal gas that these assumptions apply which means that we can use the equations that describe ideal gases to describe the behavior of lots of real-life situations too and each of these laws is named after a uniquely awesome individual who lived hundreds of years ago the first is called boyle s law and it says that as you increase the pressure of a gas while holding the temperature constant the volume of the gas will go down -- and vice versa when you increase the pressure you re squeezing the molecules together so they occupy less space the second basic law is called charles s law and it says that as you increase the temperature of a gas while holding the pressure constant the volume of the gas will go up -- and vice versa raising the temperature of the gas gives the molecules more energy which means they can rocket around more forcefully expanding the size of the container so far we ve talked about how the properties of an ideal gas relate to each other when you hold the temperature constant and when you hold the pressure constant so you can probably guess what the third law is for it s called gay-lussac s law and it says that as you increase the temperature of a gas while holding the volume constant the pressure of the gas will go up -- and vice versa what s happening here is that the increase in temperature again gives the gas molecules more energy and a higher speed but this time the size of the container is fixed so the molecules hit the sides of the container more often and with more force increasing the pressure inside all three of these laws can be combined into one main equation known simply as the ideal gas law which also takes into account the amount of the gas pressure times volume is equal to the number of moles in the gas x r x the temperature also known as p v equals n r t the n stands for the number of moles of the gas a mole is just a unit that s used to measure the amount of a substance -- in this case a gas in terms of the number of molecules if you have one mole of a gas it means that you have x molecules of the stuff r meanwhile is what s called the universal gas constant it s a number that connects the pressure and volume of an ideal gas to the number of moles of the gas and its temperature and for every ideal gas -- as long as your units are consistent -- r will be exactly the same number the ideal gas law includes the three basic laws we just talked about how pressure changes with volume how temperature changes with volume and how pressure changes with temperature but instead of talking about each of those relationships individually it lets you relate all four properties of a gas -- including how much gas you have to see all of this in action let s consider how the ideal gas law relates to your commute let s say that as part of your daily routine you drive to school once in the morning and once in the afternoon it s pretty chilly in your car as you drive in the morning -- about kelvin -- and you don t bother to turn on the heat by the time the afternoon comes along it s much warmer in your car -- about kelvin -- but you don t turn on the air conditioning what we want to know is how many fewer moles of air are there in your car in the afternoon your car isn t airtight so molecules of air are free to move in and out we ll say that the volume of the inside of your car where you sit is about meters cubed and that volume isn t going to change much the pressure inside your car is going to be equal to the outside air pressure which we ll take to be the standard atmospheric pressure or pascals so how many moles of air were inside your car as you drove to class in the morning well according to the ideal gas law the amount of gas in moles is equal to pressure x volume divided by temperature x the universal gas constant and pascals x meters cubed divided by the universal gas constant x kelvin is about moles so there were roughly moles of air in your car when you drove to class in the morning now how many moles of air were inside your car when you drove home in the afternoon when it was about kelvin warmer than in the morning we do the same calculation just this time with temperature equal to kelvin and find that there were only about moles of air inside your car in the afternoon that s a difference of moles so there s about less air in your car than there was in the morning just because it got a little warmer outside today you learned about temperature we talked about thermal expansion including linear and volume

team is thought cafe ', 'on november nasa s mariner probe entered orbit around mars becoming the first spacecraft to orbit another planet its mission mainly to take lots of pictures and map out the martian surface but mission engineers found themselves facing a challenge that they d never faced before on earth on our planet we talk about altitude in terms of sea level the highest point on earth for example is at the top of mount everest which is meters above sea level but mars doesn t have a sea so the mission team had to pick something else to use as a reference point they chose the point where mars s atmospheric pressure was millibars -- the minimum pressure that liquid water needs to exist that s right -- at very low pressures liquid water just isn t a thing no matter the temperature why not the answer lies in phase changes what happens when molecules don t quite live up to what we d predict for an ideal gas theme music we ve talked before about temperature and how it s a measure of the kinetic energy -- the energy of motion -- of a substance and we know that as temperature increases so does kinetic energy because of the kinetic theory of gases which describes how ideal gas molecules behave as you might remember from our last episode a gas is considered ideal if it fits a few basic assumptions first that the total volume of the gas molecules is much less than the volume of the container they re in second that these molecules only interact with each other when they collide and last that the collisions are perfectly elastic meaning that no energy is lost the kinetic theory of gases is based on the idea that if you have all these gas molecules bouncing around you can calculate the average kinetic energy of each particle we ve already talked about how in general the kinetic energy of an object is equal to half of its mass x its velocity squared and the average kinetic energy of the ideal gas molecules in a container is equal to half of a molecule s mass x the average squared velocity of the molecules and if you do the math this average kinetic energy also turns out to be equal to x a set constant k x the temperature k is just equal to the constant r we talked about last time divided by avogadro s number x the number of molecules in a mole this equation might not look like much but it s important because it tells you exactly how kinetic energy and temperature are related in an ideal gasas the kinetic energy of the gas increases temperature increases proportionally we already knew that - but now we ve done what we often have to do in physics which is back up our assumptions using math now you may have noticed something a little unusual about the way we ve been representing the velocity of these ideal gas molecules we ve been talking about their velocities in terms of averages which makes sense since we re trying to describe the overall behavior of all the molecules not individual ones to get the average kinetic energy we didn t just take the average velocity and square it instead we squared all the individual velocities then used the average of those squared values this whole average-squared-velocity thing helps our math work out and it s important to remember when you re analyzing an ideal gas the square root of the average squared velocity is what we call the root mean square speed we write it as v rms and it s a different number from the average speed say you know that a gas s temperature is kelvin and the mass of each molecule is x - kilograms and you want to find the speed of a typical molecule well we have an equation for that half the mass x the average squared velocity is equal to x k x the temperature so to get the typical speed of a gas molecule you re going to want to findthe square root of the average squared velocity which is equal to the square root of x k x the temperature divided by the mass in this case that works out to m s but m s isn t the average speed -- it s the root mean square speed so how does the root mean square speed compare to the actual speeds of the molecules in the gas well back in scottish physicist james clerk maxwell used statistical analysis to figure out the distribution of speeds in an ideal gas and it looks like this the top of the curve shows the speed that s close to the speed of the greatest number of molecules and the root mean square speed is slightly to the right of that so the molecules in an ideal gas can actually have a whole range of different speeds but most of them are pretty close to the root mean square speed so it s a useful way to get a picture of how fast a gas s molecules are moving now we ve seen the smooth even way pressure and volume change with temperature in an ideal gas but gases aren t always ideal when the pressure gets too high or the temperature too low they start to act very strange high pressure is a problem because it forces molecules together to the point where they start to interact low temperature is an issue for similar reasons the molecules have less kinetic energy -- they re moving around less energetically --so their attraction to each other starts to have an effect and remember we said that one of our assumptions about ideal gases was that they don t have forces acting between molecules they just bounce off of each other like ping pong balls so at higher pressures and lower temperatures real gases tend to have a bit less volume than ideal gases would and at really high pressures and really low temperatures gases just start acting weird and then eventually they aren t even gases anymore at a certain point the attraction between the molecules takes over and stops them from bouncing around so much they become slightly more ordered and take the form that we call a liquid like when water vapor from the air condenses on the outside of your nice cool glass of orange juice kind of making it look like it s sweating increase the pressure or lower the temperature even more and the attraction between the molecules has even more of an effect the liquid freezes into a solid in the same way lowering a solid s pressure or raising its temperature will eventually make it melt into a liquid and then boil into a gas well usually take a look at this diagram it shows the different phases of water depending on its pressure and temperature the vertical axis shows pressure so the higher up you go in the diagram the more pressure there is the horizontal axis shows temperature so the farther you are to the right the higher the temperature below the diagonal line so at low pressures and high temperatures water takes the form of water vapor a gas to the left of the line that s nearly vertical water is ice a solid and at the pressures and temperatures represented by the triangle in the middle water is a liquid but you ll notice that there s a point toward the top right labeled the critical point on a phase diagram the critical point represents the maximum temperature and pressure where the substance can be a liquid for a gas to become a liquid it has to be below a certain temperature known as the critical temperature for water the critical temperature is about kelvin above the critical temperature you can increase the pressure as much as you want but the gas will never condense into a liquid there s a critical pressure too which for water is about megapascals if the pressure is above the critical pressure you can raise the temperature as much as you want but the liquid will never boil then there s the point toward the bottom left where the two lines intersect that s the triple point and that s what mariner used to map out mars a triple point is the temperature and pressure at which a substance coexists as a solid a liquid and a gas it s also what we use to define the kelvin temperature scale the triple point of water is millibars and exactly kelvin that pressure and temperature is special because at thermal equilibrium water can exist in three phases at once -- ice liquid and vapor now you ll notice on the diagram that at pressures and temperatures below the triple point there s only the gas phase and the solid phase that s because below its triple point a substance can t actually take a liquid form instead it s either a gas or a solid -- and it transitions directly from one to the other a process that s known as sublimation if it goes from solid to gas and as deposition if it goes from gas to solid that s why dry ice which is made of carbon dioxide vaporizes directly to gas the triple point of carbon dioxide is about times atmospheric pressure so liquid carbon dioxide can t naturally exist on earth the triple point of water is used to define the kelvin temperature scale because it s consistent you just find the temperature where you get three phases of water at once-- which scientists have set to be kelvin by definition it also made a lot of sense for the mariner mission to use the pressure of the triple point of water as the reference point for its martian maps one of our main goals in exploring mars has always been to search for evidence of life either now or in the past and as far as we know life needs liquid water since the reference point for martian altitudes was the triple point of water liquid watercouldn t exist at altitudes above the reference point where the pressure would be too low that made it easy to see on a map all the places where liquid water could be --or have been -- and where life could possibly survive or have survived today you learned about the kinetic theory of gases and how to calculate the root mean square speed we also talked about phase changes including the critical point the triple point and how that all applies on mars crash course physics is produced in association

there are people who don t wear clothes of course but most of us do and it s not just because of modesty or a fear of getting arrested for indecent exposure you might be perfectly comfortable in just a t-shirt and shorts but take them off and eventually you ll probably start to feel cold walk around your house naked for a while -- in the interest of physics you understand -- and you ll see what i mean that chill you ll start to feel is all because of the flow of heat theme music in thermodynamics there are a few different ways to describe the kinetic energy of a system we ve already talked about one of them temperature -- the measure of the average kinetic energy of each individual molecule in a substance another measure of the kinetic energy of a system is internal energy also known as thermal energy represented by the letter u thermal energy is the kinetic energy of all the molecules in a system added together --as opposed to temperature which was a measure of the average kinetic energy for each molecule so to find the thermal energy in a system you just multiply the average kinetic energy by the number of molecules and last time we learned that the equation for the average kinetic energy of an ideal gas was equal to x k x the temperature so the thermal energy of an ideal gas is equal to the number of molecules in the system multiplied by x k x the temperature now the amount of thermal energy that s added to or removed from a system is what we call heat if i asked you describe heat to someone who d never heard of it before you might have some trouble it s hard to define what heat is exactly just based on our own perceptions for a long time scientists described heat as a kind of fluid since it flows from one system to another but these days we know that heat isn t actually a fluid it s the energy that s transferred between systems when they re at different temperatures in equations we represent heat using the capital letter q and in our daily lives we often measure heat in units called calories the units you see on nutrition labels are actually kilocalories or a thousand calories but in the official international system of units we use joules one calorie is defined as the amount of energy it takes to increase the temperature of one gram of water by one degree celsius -- or one kelvin one calorie is equal to joules simple enough so the flow of heat changes the temperature of a system but exactly how much it changes the temperature depends on two things the first is the system s mass the more mass a system has the more heat it takes to change its temperature more massive systems have more matter after all so it takes more energy to change its average kinetic energy but a temperature change also depends on something called the specific heat specific heat is a measure of how well a substance stores heat every substance has its own specific heat and the higher it is the more energy transfer-- in the form of heat -- it takes to change its temperature water for example has a very high specific heat compared to say aluminum that means it takes much more heat to change the temperature of water compared to aluminum in general the amount of heat transferred to or from a substance is equal to the massx the specific heat which we designate with a small c x the change in temperature and if q -- which represents heat -- is positive that means heat is flowing into the system if q is negative the heat is flowing out but there s another factor that affects the way heat flow relates to temperature and that is phase changes let s say you have a kilogram of ice at - degrees celsius and standard atmospheric pressure then you start adding heat to it what happens well we know that the ice s temperature will start to increase but at a certain point -- when the temperature hits celsius -- it ll stop increasing because the ice is melting then instead of raising the ice s temperature the heat you add goes toward changing its phase from solid to liquid and later once it s all melted the temperature of the water increases again as you add more heat until it gets to degrees and at that point again -- the temperature stops changing this time because the water s boiling when all the water has been converted to steam adding more heat will make the temperature rise once more so we don t use that earlier equation to describe the heat transfer while a substance s phase is changing instead the amount of heat that gets transferred during a phase change is equal to the mass times what s known as the latent heat latent heat is the heat required to change the phase of a substance and like specific heat its value depends on the substance the value also depends on the phase change for a change from solid to liquid for example it s known as the heat of fusion and for a change from liquid to gas it s called the heat of vaporization so that s how heat affects phase changes but what about how heat spreads that s the real key to figuring out why wearing clothes is so great there are three main ways for heat to spread conduction convection and radiation they each occur depending on the circumstances and heat can often spread in two or even all three different ways at the same time in conduction heat flow depends on physical contact between molecules which transfer their kinetic energy among each other it s like when the spoon you use to stir your tea gets warm heat is conducted from your hot tea to your metal spoon and what determines how much heat will be conducted over time well the bigger the temperature difference between molecules and the bigger the cross-sectional area that the heat s flowing through the faster the heat flow but the farther apart the molecules are the slower it ll flow conductivity also depends on the material -- metal for example conducts heat much faster than wood in equations we represent this inherent conductivity known as thermal conductivity using the letter k the higher the value for k is the higher the thermal conductivity of the material and the faster heat flows and there s an equation for heat conduction over time that puts together all of these different factors it says that heat flow over time between two points -- that s q over t -- is equal tok x the cross-sectional area x the temperature difference between the two points all divided by the distance between them another way that heat can spread is through convection which is kind of like conduction in the sense that it still depends on contact between molecules but in convection the molecules aren t just bumping into each other because they happen to be nearby -- instead they travel much farther it s kind of like the molecules are being stirred in convection warmer molecules generally move away from the heat source and are replaced by cooler molecules which are then heated up in a tea kettle for example the water is heated from the bottom so the water at the bottom warms up first that warmer water expands and rises and is replaced by cooler water which then also heats up but convection only happens because the heat source is positioned in a way that makes the warmer water move away from it -- it s at the bottom of the kettle if the heat source were at the top of the kettle the water at the top of the kettle would warm up first and it would basically stay put so the colder water wouldn t be able to take its place as a result the warm and cold water wouldn t get mixed around so it wouldn t be heated by convection finally there s radiation which doesn t depend on the movement of molecules instead heat is transferred by electromagnetic waves we normally consider the infrared part of the spectrum to be heat and we can describe the way heat radiates from an object over time with an equation just like we do for conduction but this one works a little differently the bigger the object s area the faster it will radiate heat and the same is true for temperature specifically the amount of heat that an object radiates over time is proportional to its temperature raised to the fourth power meaning if you double an object s temperature you multiply the heat it radiates over time by sixteen so temperature s a big deal when it comes to radiation but radiation also depends on what s known as the emissivity constant which is based on a material s inherent ability to radiate heat the higher the emissivity constant the more it radiates the equation that combines all these variables together to describe how much heat an objectradiates over time is called the stefan-boltzmann equation and it says that heat emitted over time is equal to the emissivity constant x a special number known as the stefan-boltzmann constantx the object s area x temperature raised to the fourth power now that we ve gone through all the different ways that heat transfers we can finally answerwhy do we wear clothes well it s simple otherwise we d lose a lot of heat your body loses heat in all kinds of ways one of the main ones is convection -- if your skin is warmer than the surrounding air then you ll transfer heat to the air and air moves around a lot so pretty soon the warmer air gets swept away and replaced by cooler air and you lose more heat from heating up that replacement air clothes help by trapping air against your skin sure you lose heat as you warm up that air but then the warm air stays close to your body so you don t lose too much more you can also lose heat through radiation if the walls floor and ceiling of the room you re in are colder than you you ll radiate more heat to them than they ll radiate to you clothes don t stop you from radiating heat but they can keep you warm enough for the heat that your body produces to keep up with the heat you re losing through radiation just another good reason to stay dressed whenever possible today you learned about thermal energy as well as heat and how much of it you needfor both temperature changes and phase changes we also talked about heat flow through conduction convection and radiation crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can

crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'this little toy is called a drinking bird you put a cup of water in front of it and its head dunks into the cup eventually the head bobs up again but then it goes right back into the water if you don t know much about thermodynamics the drinking bird might seem like it could go on forever without an external source of energy powering it a perpetual motion machine in other words but the toy isn t a perpetual motion machine because perpetual motion is impossible according to the laws of physics one of the reasons is the first law of thermodynamics theme music one of the main goals of thermodynamics is to describe the transfer of energy we ve already described two processes as a transfer of energy work and heat and they re both connected to each other as a thermodynamic system does work it loses heat when work is done on a system it gains heat so heat is converted to work and work is converted to heat together the work and heat transferred into or out of the system represent the change in its internal energy which as you might recall is the total kinetic and potential energy of all the molecules in the system this idea that the change in internal energy is equal to the change in work plus the change in heat is so fundamental that it s known as the first law of thermodynamics so we can have an equation to use for analyzing problems we write the first law like this the internal energy u of a closed system is equal to q the heat transfer to the system minus w the work done on or by the system it s important to remember that when we talk about changes in internal energy if heat is transferred into the system q is positive and if heat is transferred out of the system q is negative and if work is done on the system w is negative and if work is done by the system w is positive some textbooks will change those signs around so it s worth keeping track of what the positives and negatives mean now you ll notice that the first law of thermodynamics describes only those two factors work and heat as affecting a change in internal energy that s because as long as the system is closed meaning it s isolated from therest of the universe there just aren t any other factors involved the amount of heat lost by the system is exactly equal to the amount of work done by the system and vice versa so really the first law of thermodynamics is just another way to describe the conservation of energy which keeps coming up in our lessons because it s such a key principle of physics there s always some kind of heat loss like through friction even that tiny amount means that the motion can t continue forever it will eventually run out of the energy it needs to drive the work it s doing that s part of why the drinking bird isn t a perpetual motion machine it relies on the energy it gets from the cup of water to power its movement the bird is filled with a fluid that has a low boiling point so it can easily change from a gas to a liquid and back with just a slight change in temperature there s some liquid at the bottom and some vapor at the top when the bird s head dips into the cup it gets wet it keeps bobbing back and forth for a while and as the water evaporates it cools the vapor in the bird s head which condenses into liquid creating a partial vacuum in the head that makes liquid travel up the tube the head gets heavier and dips back into the water but the tipping makes a bubble rise through the liquid into the bird s head sending more liquid into the bottom and setting the little bird swinging and starting the cycle all over again but it still needs the water for it to do its thing once the water in the cup runs out the bird stops moving now there are four basic types of processes where the thermodynamic properties of a system generally an ideal gas in some kind of container can change according to the first law in each case one property is held constant volume pressure temperature or heat while the other properties change variations on all these properties are used in all kinds of machines especially engines first there are iso-volumetric processes where the volume is held constant usually because the gas is in a rigid container while heat is added or removed as you add heat the pressure of the gas will increase and so will its temperature as you remove heat the pressure and temperature will decrease isovolumetric processes are kind of boring as thermodynamic processes go the gas is stuck inside its container and no matter how much heat you add the gas doesn t do any work you re just increasing its internal energy but isobaric processes where the pressure is held constant while heat is added or removed are a little more interesting here the volume of the container is allowed to change usually because the gas can move a piston as you add heat the volume and temperature of the system increase and as you remove heat the volume and temperature decrease which means that an isobaric process can do work here s why in earlier episodes we ve said that work is equal to force x distance in this case the distance the piston moves we ve also said that pressure is equal to force area which means that force is equal to pressure x area here it s the pressure of the gas x the area of the piston so work is equal to the gas s pressure x the piston s area x the distance it moves and one more step the area of the piston x the distance it moves will be equal to the change in the volume of the container so the work done during an isobaric process is equal to the pressure of the gas x the change in volume if heat is added the volume goes up and the piston moves outward so the system does work if you push the piston inward you re doing work on the system so its volume goes down the third type of thermodynamic processes are isothermal that s where temperature is held constant usually by connecting the system to a much bigger system whose temperature would take a lot of heat to change known as a heat reservoir the heat or volume of the system is then changed very slowly so that the other propertiescan adjust while the temperature essentially stays constant an isothermal process is kind of like an isobaric process in that if you add heat the volume will expand so the system will do work but for isothermal processes you can t use that simple w p delta v equation because the pressure does change instead you need to take the integral of the pressure with respect to volume this way you re still calculating work but you re taking the changes in pressure into account too another difference between isobaric and isothermal processes is that since temperature is held constant in isothermal processes the internal energy of the ideal gas can t change and the first law of thermodynamics says that heat minus work is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system in this case zero so the work done by the system will be equal to the amount of heat added and vice versa finally there are adiabatic processes where no heat is allowed to flow in or out of the system but the gas can expand or be compressed again the equation for the first law of thermodynamics helps us out here q is zero because the heat of the system isn t changing but the internal energy of the gas can change so the system can do work or have work done on it in fact the change in the internal energy of the gas will be exactly equal to the negative of the work but this is all just the first law of thermodynamics there s also the second law which says that heat will spontaneously flow from something hotter to something colder but it won t flow from something colder to something hotter and that s because of this thing called entropy entropy is often described as the inherent disorder of a system the more disordered the system the higher its entropy so a gas for example with all its molecules randomly bouncing around has a higher entropy than a solid with its molecules neatly arranged and a more general way to state the second law of thermodynamics is that in real life entropy can only increase overall that doesn t mean entropy can never decrease in certain situations like gases do sometimes turn into liquids or solids obviously you ve seen water vapor condense and liquid water freeze but if the entropy in a system decreases that means the entropy of the environment around the system must increase enough to compensate and then some so that there s an overall increase in the entropy of the universe say you put water in your freezer to make ice for example the entropy of the water goes down as it freezes but meanwhile your freezer is putting out heat as it works to keep itself cold inside and the heat from your freezer is increasing the entropy of your kitchen more than the entropy of the ice is decreasing so overall there s an increase in the entropy of the universe remember that every time you re making ice you re increasing the disorder of the universe now entropy s tendency to increase has to do with probability to see what i mean picture a shattered ceramic mug there are molecules that make up that mug and there are lots and lots of ways that those molecules can be arranged in space and all of them are equally likely but only in a few of those arrangements can the molecules make up a whole solid unshattered cup the state where they have a lower entropy still there are lots of possible arrangements of those molecules where they could make up a shattered cup a set of pieces with a higher entropy the cup can be shattered into pieces pieces with the pieces far apart or very close together and every way the cup can shatter is another possible way for the molecules inside the pieces to be arranged but when there are so many ways for the cup to be broken and so few ways for it to be whole it becomes very very unlikely that the pieces will spontaneously put themselves back together if you drop them basically it ll never happen on the other hand it s very likely that a cup that s whole will break when you drop it so the process that leads to an increase in entropy has a much higher probability of happening and in thermodynamics entropy is related to heat flow because when heat flows between systems their entropy increases before when their molecules were different temperatures that was an orderly arrangement but when their temperatures become equal that neat organization is gone so the systems have a higher entropy so heat spontaneously flows from warmer systems to cooler ones because that leads to an increase in entropy which is also why this little bird keeps bopping up and down when the heat flows out of it the gas condenses and it dunks into the water the bird may not be a perpetual motion machine but it s a great way to see the first and second laws of thermodynamics in action today you learned about the first law of thermodynamics and how it applies to isovolumetric isobaric isothermal and adiabatic processes we also talked about the second law of thermodynamics and entropy crash course physics is produced

developments throughout history that led to the conveniences you enjoy today if i had to pick the biggest game-changer in human technology it would probably be the steam engine during the industrial revolution the steam engine powered machines in farms and factories and although it may not seem so those advances eventually led to the technologies that you re using to watch me right now so the steam engine was a pretty big deal developing a practical steam engine involved a lot of time and a lot smart people and about a hundred years and three main inventors and it took a solid understanding of thermodynamic processes and heat engines to make this world-changing technology a reality theme music heat engines like steam engines turn thermal energy into mechanical work and they do it in a repeating cycle the process starts at a high operating temperature which we label as t h and ends up at a lower operating temperature t l in the process the engine takes the input heat that was used to raise the temperature known as q h and turns some of it into work while also releasing some heat q l as exhaust then the engine s temperature is raised once more so it can start the cycle all over again ok now think back to the first law of thermodynamics which says that the change in the thermal energy of a system is equal to heat and work in the case of a heat engine the change in thermal energy is zero because it always returns to the temperature it started from so the engine s input heat must be equal to the work it does plus the heat it releases now let s see how this plays out in a steam engine there are a few different types of steam engine but we ll focus on the basic reciprocating type as long as you have something to quot heat quot the steam like coal or oil the engine keeps working that s the input heat the input heat is used to heat a volume of water which turns to steam then an intake valve opens allowing the steam into the engine the steam expands and moves a piston outward that s the work done by the engine then the intake valve closes and an exhaust valve opens the exhaust valve leads to a condenser which cools the steam back into water the lower temperature also lowers the pressure creating a partial vacuum that makes the piston move back into its original position then the water gets heated back into steam and the cycle starts over as the engine runs the motion of the piston can be translated into all kinds of different movement which is how steam engines can do things like move trains and boats and run factory lines but as the steam engine runs it releases exhaust heat the more exhaust heat it produces the less efficient the engine is and the more energy you have to put in for the same amount of work obviously it s important for engines to be as efficient as possible to save energy and to design an efficient engine engineers have to be able to calculate its efficiency like we said earlier an engine s input heat is equal to the work it does plus its exhaust heat and the more work and therefore the less exhaust heat you get out of the input heat the more efficient your engine is so efficiency is equal to the work done by an engine divided by its input heat we can also put this just in terms of input heat and exhaust heat pretty easily actually we know that work is equal to input heat minus exhaust heat so efficiency is equal to input heat minus exhaust heat divided by the input heat or simplifying those terms efficiency is equal to - exhaust heat input heat if your engine produced no exhaust heat at all we d say that its efficiency was exactly it would be perfectly efficient but there s no such thing as an engine that produces no exhaust heat at all it wouldn t work because the temperature needs to be lowered and then raised again for the engine to keep going but we can imagine an ideal engine where none of the exhaust energy is waste heat where there s no friction or anything like that an ideal engine would also be reversible meaning you could run it backward putting in work to transfer heat from something with a lower temperature to something with a higher temperature this kind of hypothetical engine is called a carnot engine and we can use it to figure out the maximum possible efficiency of a real-life engine last time we talked about the four types of basic thermodynamic processes the carnot engine combines two of those types into what s known as the carnot cycle but in the carnot cycle those processes don t transfer heat between areas with different temperatures because if an engine involves heat transfer from an area with a higher temperature to an area with a lower temperature then reversing the engine would involve transferring heat from lower to higher which would violate the second law of thermodynamics so in the carnot cycle heat won t flow between areas of different temperatures at all instead the cycle goes through two adiabatic processes where heat is held constant and two isothermal processes where heat is transferred but the temperature is held constant so the heat never flows between areas of different temperatures now you might be wondering how heat gets transferred if there s no difference in temperature well remember how we described isothermal processes last time in those cases there are only very tiny differences in temperature and they re immediately eliminated so practically speaking there is no transfer of heat between areas of different temperatures and this means the process can still be reversed with all that in mind here s how a carnot engine works at least in theory because again carnot engines are totally hypothetical the first process in the cycle is isothermal the temperature is constant but heat is slowly added that makes the gas s volume expand and its pressure decrease path a-b on this diagram the second process is adiabatic the temperature drops while the heat stays constant which also makes the volume expand and the pressure decrease that s path b-c on the diagram the third process is the opposite of the first one and it s also isothermal the gas is compressed while the temperature is held constant so it releases heat and its pressure increases while its volume decreases that s path c-d the last process is the opposite of the second it s adiabatic so the gas is compressed but its heat doesn t change that makes the gas s volume decrease and its pressure increase like in path d-a its temperature goes back up to the starting point the carnot engine is the ideal engine because it produces the most possible work from a given temperature difference and because a carnot engine is as efficient as possible the high and low temperatures are proportional to the input and exhaust heat which is important math-wise because it means that in the equation for efficiency you can replace q h and q l the input and exhaust heat with t h and t l the higher and lower operating temperatures which can help if you don t know an engine s input and exhaust heats but you know its operating temperatures so the ideal efficiency for an engine is equal to - its low temperature its high temperature the colder that lower operating temperature is the more efficient the ideal version of the engine is so say you need an engine to power a life-size mario kart that you re building for yourself you find an engine online and you re thinking about buying it but first you want to know how efficient it is the manufacturer s website says that for every second the engine s input heat is kilojoules at kelvin its exhaust heat is kilojoules at kelvin the efficiency equation says that the engine s efficiency is equal to - its exhaust heat its input heat in this case that would be a very efficient engine so you should be a little suspicious i mean is that kind of efficiency even possible you can find out by checking the ideal efficiency of the engine the carnot efficiency the ideal efficiency is equal to - its lower operating temperature its higher operating temperature which in this case is equal to it s impossible for this engine to have an efficiency higher than so the manufacturer s website is well just lying so you probably shouldn t buy anything from them anyway and actually you probably wouldn t want an engine that was close to the efficiency of a carnot engine because carnot engines are very slow during those isothermal processes the temperature has to be kept constant while heat is transferred which only works if the heat is transferred super slowly so the engine has to be really slow if you had a carnot engine in your car for example it would take you a whole day to get out of your driveway real-life heat engines are useful because they use the flow of heat from something warmer to something cooler to produce work but what if you want heat to flow from something cooler to something warmer that s what things like air conditioners and refrigerators do and they were originally developed using the principles scientists had learned from creating steam engines these cooling machines are a lot like the opposite of heat engines in the sense that they use work to make heat flow in the opposite direction that it would normally go the refrigerator for example passes a cool liquid through the inside of the fridge the liquid absorbs heat that s q l as it evaporates then the fridge uses a motor to do work on the now-warmer fluid which has turned into a gas it s passed through coils on the outside of the refrigerator where it releases the exhaust heat q h and cools to become a liquid again then the cycle starts over for heat engines efficiency is measured by the work produced for a given amount of input heat and there s a similar concept for refrigerators the coefficient of performance or cop which is equal to the amount of heat removed from the lower-temperature zone divided by work the more heat the fridge removes for a given amount of work the higher the coefficient of performance like we did with the efficiency equation we can rewrite the cop equation just in terms of q l and q h the coefficient of performance is equal to q l divided by q h minus q l to find the coefficient of performance for an ideal refrigerator we do the same thing we did with the ideal carnot engine replace q l with t l and q h with t h so for an ideal fridge the coefficient of performance would be equal to the lower operating temperature divided by the higher operating temperature minus the lower operating temperature and of course a real-life refrigerator can t have a higher coefficient of performance than an ideal refrigerator now it may not be surprising that steam engines and refrigerators are total opposites but fridges and freezers and air conditioning are all game-changing inventions that were only made possible by our knowledge of steam engines today you learned about how engines turn thermal energy into work and how to calculate their efficiency we also described the carnot engine and finally we talked about cooling machines like refrigerators crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can

make your hair stick up or of course a lightning strike they re all governed by the same principle static electricity static electricity occurs when an object obtains a net amount of positive or negative electric charge creating an imbalance that wants to be returned to equilibrium its effects aren t always as dramatic as lightning though let s take two pieces of tape that are both stuck to a table if you rip them both off the table and try to stick them together that should be easy enough right but it turns out that they repel one another but try this stick one on top of the other rip the pair off the table and then separate the pieces they re no longer repelled now they re attracted to one another in the first scenario both pieces of tape stole negative charges from the table and since like-charges repel the pieces moved away from one another in the second scenario one piece of tape stole negative charges from the other leaving the pieces with opposite overall charges making them attract our study of electricity begins here with basic observations about electric charges that hundreds of years ago sparked the imagination and innovation that changed our world forever theme music to understand electricity you should start with an atom atoms contain charged particles positive protons and negative electrons and generally there s an equal number of each meaning the net electric charge of the atom is it s electrically neutral in solid materials protons stay fixed but some electrons are free to move around these moving electrons are called free electrons they reside in an atom s outer shell as valence electrons and are easily plucked off and carried around when acted upon by an outside force how easy it is for electrons to move around depends on the material and we describe the materials in the same manner we do for heat transfer with conductors and insulators materials that are conductors like copper let free electrons move freely throughout the solid while insulators like wood hold on to them tightly limiting their flow so we ve got insulators and conductors with free electrons moving around in them but what causes these charged particles to move in the first place the answer is an imbalance of electrical charge when some part of an object has a different number of free electrons than another part when we talk about an object having an overall negative charge we mean that it has too many electrons and when we talk about an object having an overall positive charge we mean it s missing free electrons this imbalance can be created and resolved in lots of different ways say you have a glass rod that s electrically neutral and you rub it with a cloth that physical interaction causes electrons to hop onto the cloth leaving the rod with an overall positive charge this is called charging by friction both the cloth and rod began with a neutral charge but after friction the rod has a net positive charge but whether the rod ends up with a net positive or negative charge depends on the materials that you use the ancient greeks actually rubbed fur against amber and discovered that the amber would then attract hair and feathers today we understand that the fur stole electrons during the process giving the amber an overall positive charge just like the glass rod now it s important to note that no new charges were created during this process the overall charge between the two objects is still zero this is known as the law of conservation of electric charge it says that you can never create a net electric charge instead charge can only move from one place to another now if we bring our positively charged glass rod in contact with another neutral rod some of the negative charge that is some electrons will jump from the neutral rod to the positive one until both objects have the same distribution of charge so now we have two rods that are both slightly positive this is called charging by contact when the two objects touched charges moved between them ok so charges can move when different materials touch each other either through friction or simple contact but materials don t actually have to touch in order for their electrons to get all rearranged say you bring a positively charged rod close to a metal conductive rod then the electrons in part of the metal rod will be drawn towards the positive rod now the side with more electrons has a negative charge leaving the other side of the rod with fewer electrons and a positive charge you know what we ve done here we ve polarized the metal rod we ve redistributed the charge in order to create an imbalance of charge within an object an object that s still electrically neutral now imagine that we slice the metal rod right down the center it still hasn t touched the positive rod but since we split it while an imbalance was present we re left with one positive side and one negative side this process is known as charging by induction creating a net charge without contacting another object now if a charged object is connected to a much larger neutral conducting object then the net charge gets redistributed so that the smaller object loses most of its net charge how large an object are we talking about exactly well how about earth the earth s surface is a fairly good conductor in most places and for our purposes it can be considered neutral so connecting a charged object to the ground creates a way for the charge to leak into the earth rendering the object electrically neutral this is known as grounding so let s say we repeat the previous experiment but we bring a negatively charged rod close to our neutral one the neutral rod becomes polarized with a net positive charge close to the charged rod and a negative charge on the opposite side but if we ground the metal rod the negative charges repelled by the charged rod now have a place to go the earth the negative charges scurry away leaving the metal rod with an overall positive charge now if we sever the connection to the ground our rod remains positively charged this process required no contact between the rods only a connection to the ground ok so we ve talked about how opposite charges attract and like charges repel but how do we quantify those interactions in terms of equations and units well we ll want to find the force on charged particles in newtons but to calculate the number of newtons we ll first need to measure the charge denoted by q in units called coulombs since objects can be positively or negatively charged q can have both positive and negative values for example one electron has a charge of negative times to the negative th coulombs that means there are times to the th electrons for every negative coulomb this value the charge of a single electron in coulombs is known as the elementary charge and it s denoted with a lowercase e we ll use this notation a lot when talking about protons and electrons since protons have a charge of positive e and electrons of negative e now that we have a way to measure the charge we can calculate the force between particles and the equation we use is very similar to the one we use with gravitation it s just that instead of using kilograms to find newtons here we re using coulombs to find newtons our equation here states that the force between two charged particles is equal to the productof the two charges divided by the distance between them squared and the distance is squared because just like gravitation when the distance between objects doubles the force between them reduces to a quarter of the original value and also as with gravitation this force has its own proportionality constant it s labeled lower-case k and its value depends on the medium that surrounds the charges the vast majority of the time the medium you ll be working with will just be the air or possibly a vacuum and in both cases the constant is times to the ninth coulombs so when you multiply the rest of the expression by k that gives the result in terms of newtons this whole expression is known as coulomb s law and k is often known as the coulomb s law constant now gravitation and electrostatic forces work in totally different ways of course so we have to express them differently too the force of gravity after all is always attractive but the electrostatic forces can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the signs of the charges so the product of the two charges can be negative or positive with the resulting sign of f being plus or minus corresponding to either attraction or repulsion now let s put coulomb s law to the test let s say there are two electrons that are nanometer apart that s times to the - meters you can calculate the force between them by multiplying their charges which are both - times to the - coulombs divided by the distance between them squared you then multiply that by k and the resulting force is positive times to the - newtons now notice that the answer is positive that means the electrons repel one another if we used a proton and an electron the same distance apart we d get - times to the - newtons meaning they d attract one another and just like other forces vector addition also applies here too this means we can solve for the net force on a charge by using coulomb s law on each pair of charges in any situation from coulomb s law we can calculate the magnitude of the force and find the direction based on the sign of the result so from a simple trick with tape and the help of a couple of animated rods we ve already uncovered the basics of electrostatic forces next time we ll learn about electric fields and how to visualize their effect on neighboring objects today we learned about electrostatic forces and how electrical charge can be altered and rearranged we also discussed coulomb s law and how the force between charged particles is calculated using vectors crash course physics is produced in

crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'last time we talked about how charged particles exert electrostatic forces on one another we calculated these forces using the charge of each particle which can be either positive or negative and the distance between them and we did it with the help of coulomb s law the equation that tells us the force generated by two charged particles on one another but what if we want to talk about more that two charges or if we re dealing with charged objects of various shapes and sizes coulomb s law is great for finding the force between small objects like particles but in physics we deal with all sorts of shapes and sizes electric forces are used to bring power to your home charge your computer and light up the screen that you re using to watch this video these everyday electric phenomena require physical components that manipulate charged particles in amazing ways we make electrical components that excite millions of electrons in each pixel on this screen but how to we design then to transmit just the right amount of electric force we ve got some equations and concepts under our belt already but we ll need a few more to understand how to control charged particles and expand the possibilities of electricity theme music so we want to describe complex situations involving charged particles using more than just coulomb s law if we have an object with a knows amount of net charge can we predict how other electric charges will react when they pass nearby well british scientist michael faraday came up with a way to do just that he hypothesized that every charged object generates an electric field that permeates space and exerts a force on all charged particles it encounters and he was right an electric field is a measurable effect generated by any charged object a field carries energy and passes it on to other charged materials by exerting electric forces and we can get to know how electric fields work in a couple of different ways first there s good old math let s consider a positive point charge which we ll call capital q to study the effect that big q has on other charges we ll bring in a small positive test charge small q and measure the force that s acting on it now when we express it as an equation the electric field created by a charged object is the electric force between the objects and the test charge divided by the magnitude of that test charge to find f you just have to use coulomb s law and you only need to know the value for big q the point charge in fact you can plug the equation for coulomb s law into this equation in place of capital f and if you do you ll see that the magnitude of the test charge cancels out and we re left with an expression that relies solely on big q now we ve got an equation to calculate the electric field generated by any point charge but let s make this field even easier to picture another way of understanding what s going on between these charges is to diagram it with vectors using what we ve learned about coulomb s law and force vectors again let s start with our positive point charge capital q located at point a and our small positive test charge small q while both big q and small q generate electric fields we re going to assume that big q has a much larger magnitude than small q now let s plot a series of vectors that result from placing small q at various points around big q these vectors are called electric field lines and their purpose is to show the magnitude and direction of the force exerted on any nearby positive test charge the density of these field lines signifies the magnitude of the electric force on small q and the closer small q is to big q the greater the force and the same logic applies to how we represent negative charges although we do implement it in a slightly different way the electric field line diagram for a fixed q that s negatively charged would look like that of a positive q but with arrows pointing inward to signify that positive test charges would be attracted to q now let s see what an electric field looks like for a more complicated situation say we have one positively charged particle and one negatively charged particle that are some distance apart with an equal and opposite magnitude of charge this pair of particle is known as an electric dipole since we have two particles that each generate their own electric field we can add the fields together to create a total electric field this is the principle known as superposition now let s examine the electric field created by this electric dipole because along the way that s going to show us four important properties of electric field lines first the field lines must be tangent to the direction of the field at any point this means if we place a positive test charge anywhere the field lines will point in the direction of the force exerted on a positive test charge this also means that a negative test charge would feel a force in the exact opposite direction next the greater the line density the greater the magnitude of the field as a test charge moves closer to one of the fixed charges the forces on it will be larger thus the greater number of lines in that area all of this together means that the number of lines leaving a charged object is proportional to the magnitude of its charge if the magnitude of the positive charge in our electric dipole is doubled then twice as many lines leave the positive point charge the third property of electric field lines is that the lines always start from positively charged objects and end on negatively charged objects and if there are no negatively charged objects around then the lines just keep going on foreverinto infinity seeking out negatively charged objects wherever they can find them so in our electric dipole the lines start at the positively charged particle and move toward the negatively charged one and the same number of lines come out of each particle because the magnitude of their charges is equal and opposite finally the fourth property of electric field lines the lines must never cross criss-crossing lines means the field acts in different directions for charges in the same location which is impossible now that we know these properties we can create field lines for any set of charged objects so lets look at a scenario with one negatively charged particle with charge -q and a positively charges particle with charge q if a positive test charge were placed directly between the particles the force exerted on it would be in the same direction that the electric field points toward the negative particle if we zoom out looking at this pair of particles from far away you can see that it looks like the field lines for a single positive point charge keep in mind groups of charged particles can look totally different when viewed from far away all right you re probably wondering why we re still talking about particles when i spent all that time earlier talking about configurations of things that we see in real life now that we know how to build electric field lines based on a set up of charged objects let s try to do the reverse and set up charged objects to achieve a certain purpose let s say we want to create an electric field where all positive test charges move uniformly in a single direction we can model this as a field created by two infinitely large conductive plates one positive and one negative all positive test charges between the plates would move from the positive plate to the negative plate so we construct the electric field as a series of lines moving from the positive plate to the negative one this pair of plates is known as a capactior and is an integral part of almost every electronic system partly because it can use its electronic field to store an electric charge but so far we ve only talked about electrical fields between charged objects like particles and plates so can an electric field exist in a conductor where electrons can move around freely in the material to figure this out let s imagine we have a conductive sphere with a net negative charge meaning it has too many free electrons these extra free electrons want to move as far away from one another as possible this means they redistribute themselves on the surface of the sphere when they do they ve reached electrostatic equilibrium in this state the excess charges have moved as far as possible to reduce their forces on one another once these free charges are at equilibrium their acceleration is zero which means that there are no longer any net forces acting on them and since the electric field represents electric forces acting on nearby charges when the net forces are zero the electric field must also be zero so what do these observations tell us well for one thing it shows that the electric field inside conductors is always zero when the system is in electrostatic equilibrium and it also shows that the net charge is distributed on the surface these conditions hold true for all conducive materials while the electric field inside the material is zero an electric field exists outside the surface of the conductor let s look again at the capacitor and see what i mean you can see that all excess charge is on the surface of the plates and while no electric field exists inside the plates themselves a field is generated between the two now what if we take a neutral conductive sphere hollow out the inside and stick a positively charged particle in the center the positive charge inside the sphere attracts the negative charges inside the shell while it s pushing the positive charges to the surface of the sphere once the system is at electrostatic equilibrium the observations we made before still hold true the charges stop moving so no electric field exists inside the shell now the inside of the shell has a net negative charge due to the attraction of the central positive particle leaving the outer shell with a net positive charge so an electric field is generated from the outside of the shell because of the net positive charge and while no field exists inside the shell there is an electric field between that particle in the center and the inside surface any positive test charges in the region would follow the field lines and be pushed toward the negative interior of the shell so we ve managed to use our knowledge of electric charges and coulomb s law to figure out a way to describe the effect of any charged object on the entire universe surrounding it later we ll learn about how electric forces and fields are just half of the story in our pursuit of understanding the larger concept of electromagnetism today we learned how all objects with net charge generate electric fields that affect all other charged materials we learned how to construct electric field lines and how to calculate the magnitude and direction of the electric field for a charged particle finally we learned how electric fields interact in capacitors and conductors crash

braincraft this episode of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'you ve probably seen it on tv a bunch of times a person collapses in a hospital and a doctor rushes over with a couple of paddles puts them on the patient s chest and then shouts quot clear quot after a jolt the patient is saved that life-saving technology is real and it works because of two main electrical principles electric potential energy and capacitance those paddles are parts of a defibrillator which is basically just a really big capacitor it uses electric charge to store energy which is then discharged into the patient s body the current stops the irregular contractions of the cardiac muscle and gives the heart a chance to start beating normally get ready because this lesson has the potential to save lives theme music to understand how a capacitor can save someone s life let s review what capacitors are and how they work a capacitor consists of two parallel conductive plates of opposite charge with an electric field between them this set-up allows a capacitor to store energy as electric potential energy in the same way that an object has gravitational potential energy when you hold it above the ground a charged object can have electric potential energy when it s held in an electric field and in either case potential energy can be used to perform work when a force is applied over a distance but how can you determine how much electric potential energy a system has and how much work it can do like in the case of a defibrillator you just want enough potential energy to stop an irregular heartbeat but not so much that it causes harm to measure potential energy in an electric field let s imagine a positive test charge that s moving between a capacitor s plates when we place the positive charge between the plates the uniform electric field generates a constant force on it in the direction of the negative plate if the test charge starts on the positive plate and travels in the direction of the electric force we can calculate the work done on it by multiplying the electric force by the distance between the plates we also know that this force is equal to the value of the test charge times the electric field we can apply an equal and opposite force to the charged particle and move it across the capacitor as slowly as we like so that the kinetic energy of the particle is negligible and because of what we know about the work-energy theorem and the law of conservation of energy we know that a change of potential energy is equal to the work done by the external force or the negative work done by the electric force so we ve found the potential energy decrease of a single point charge in a uniform electric field and this drop in potential energy divided by the test charge s magnitude gives us the electric potential energy difference per unit charge also known as the electric potential the electric potential depends on the electric field and the position but it does not depend on the charge of the test charge now the units of electric potential are joules over coulombs more commonly known as volts and the electric potential difference is also called voltage which is another way of describing a drop in electric potential when we express it mathematically voltage is equal to the negative electric field times the distance between the capacitor plates ok we ve used our hypothetical positive test charge to describe how much voltage is present across the charged capacitor now let s put our new expressions to the test and find the electric potential difference in a real scenario let s say we have a capacitor with plates one millimeter apart and an electric field of newtons per coulomb which is the same as volts per meter the electric field can be found by dividing force by charge or for that matter newtons over coulombs as well as voltage over distance or volts per meter they all represent the same value so say we multiply volts per meter by mm we find that the capacitor has a voltage of one volt now since a capacitor creates a uniform electric field we can assume the electric force is constant and that it acts in the direction in which the test charge moves and as it moves the potential will decrease more and more we can represent this voltage drop visually by drawing lines along the locations where all the test charges have the same voltage these are known as equipotential lines in a capacitor these lines run parallel to the plates and each line that s closer to the negative plate has a lower electric potential or a lower voltage and these equipotential lines are always perpendicular to the electric field so far we ve learned how to calculate electric potential for capacitors but can we apply the same ideas to point charges well we know the equation for the electric field generated by a point charge but since there s no uniform field like there would be with a capacitor we can t use all of the equations that we ve been using so far finding the electric potential created by a point charge is like finding the difference in potential energy per unit charge between the spot right next to the point charge and somewhere infinitely far away if a small charged object with the same sign was next to our point charge q it would start with a high electric potential while it was close by and have a very low electric potential as it got farther away so we can calculate the total electric potential possible by integrating the negative electric field from to infinity to zero we re left with an equation that describes the electric potential generated by any point charge and we can map equipotential lines for point charges in the same way we did for the capacitor for a point charge the equipotential lines look like circles of increasing size around the charged particle the farther away from the point charge the lower the voltage and for an electric dipole which is one positive point charge and one negative point charge the electric potentials from individual charges can be added together here you ll see that each equipotential line is not a constant distance from a point charge that s because you ve got two point charges with their own electric fields so a test charge on the right side of the positive point charge won t have the same potential as one the same distance away on the opposite side now let s go back to potential energy in capacitors because it s largely why capacitors are so incredibly useful from defibrillators to electronic components when a capacitor s plates store electric charge they re actually storing energy if you connect a battery to a basic circuit that contains only a capacitor the battery causes charge to move from one plate to the other through the conductive wire this results in one positively charged plate and one negatively charged plate but the capacitor hasn t gained any net charge there s just as much positive charge on the positive plate as there is negative charge on the negative one so the battery uses its own electric potential to generate a current that transfers voltage in the battery to voltage in the capacitor giving the capacitor a certain amount of potential energy for our defibrillator this energy is quickly turned from potential energy into a jolt of electricity through the human body now if you re trying to save a life you want to make sure you re getting just the right amount of energy out of the capacitor so to measure how much charge a capacitor can store we can use a battery in our circuit to create a voltage between the plates and then divide the charge in each plate by that voltage this value is known as capacitance how much charge a capacitor is able to hold capacitance uses units of farads with one farad equal to one coulomb per volt typically capacitance values are very small so we often talk about capacitors in terms of microfarads or nanofarads and capacitance is actually determined by the size and shape of a capacitor one way to express capacitance is to divide the area of each plate by the distance between them and multiply that by a constant known as the permittivity of free space denoted by epsilon naught make the plates larger or move them closer together then there s room to fit more charge creating a stronger electric field and once you ve established the geometry of the plates the capacitance does not change unless you stick something between them which actually increases the capacitance and this something is called a dielectric typically an insulating material like plastic or glass a dielectric is used to increase capacitance while preventing any charge from jumping from plate to plate sometimes as the plates get hotter or the voltage gets higher some electrons naturally jump between the plates decreasing the amount of stored charge so an insulator prevents electrons from crossing the gap and you usually want the plates to be as close together as possible without touching since a smaller distance equals a larger capacitance so by using a very thin dielectric the distance is decreased while the plates remain separate and the molecules that make up dielectrics are polar which means one side of the molecule is slightly positive while the other side is slightly negative the molecules align themselves with the electric field and generate their own field in the opposite direction resulting in an overall weaker electric field while the plates retain the same amount of charge so by inserting an insulating material into our capacitor we ve increased capacitance and can hold more charge and thus energy for the same amount of voltage and that s why the full equation for capacitance includes a dielectric constant k so dielectrics can help capacitors hold even more energy and that potential energy is actually stored within the electric field between a capacitor s charged plates we can calculate the potential energy stored in this field by integrating the voltage over the charge in the plates which reduces down to one half charge time voltage but when using a capacitor it s useful to know how much energy is stored in an electric field per unit volume we often want to know how much energy is in a certain location like between capacitor plates so we use energy density or the amount of energy stored in the electric field per unit volume and we can calculate the energy density associated with an electric field at any point in space by dividing the potential energy by the volume between the plates with some algebra we find that this boils down to one half epsilon naught times the electric field squared and this relation holds true for any space with an electric field now that we know all this a medic can make sure those defibrillator paddles have the right capacitance have been given enough charge to create a high voltage and then clear physics to the rescue today we learned a lot we talked about electric potential energy and how it differs from electric potential or voltage we discussed how capacitors function and the factors that determine how much charge they hold we also learned how to maximize energy storage and how to calculate the potential energy held by any capacitor crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head over to their channel out a playlist of the latest episode from shows like first person pbs offbook and pbs game show this episode of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'imagine you re floating down a river maybe the stream is calm and serene flowing without obstruction or perhaps it s a rushing river churning and splashing over rocks well the way water moves in a river is a lot like how electricity flows through a wire but when we say that electricity is flowing we re really talking about the flow of electrons electric current is the total amount of charge passing through a wire over a period of time but how does current actually form what can it pass through and what determines how strong it is it s time to sit back relax and go with the flow theme music let s talk about how we get charges to flow from one place to another last time we learned that when there s a difference in electric potential between two points the voltage gives charged particles like electrons the energy to move from one place to another just like a river flows from high elevation to low elevation electric charge flows from high voltage to low voltage so we need a way to generate a voltage that gets charge to flow continuously creating an electric current before the th century scientists had been able to generate static charge by rubbing different materials together but they couldn t do much more than create small sparks they didn t fully understand what they were doing so they couldn t figure out how to create a constant voltage to generate a steady flow of electricity to solve this problem italian scientist alessandro volta invented the first voltaic cell which uses chemical reactions to create an electric potential difference between two pieces of different metals known as electrodes when the two electrodes are connected current begins to flow we call these connection points terminals and we can connect multiple voltaic cells together by placing wires between their opposite electrodes when one or more voltaic cells are combined their voltages add up and together they form a battery today s batteries operate under the same principle as the very first voltaic cell now that we have a source for our current we ll also need a ground that s connected to the wire this is just a common conductor that ensures the current always has a path to a large reservoir of charge -- usually the earth itself next once we can generate an electric current we ll need a way to describe how strongly the charge flows if you picture the cross section of a wire you can measure how much charge flows through that cross section over a period of time the amount of charge moving past this point divided by the time period gives us a value in coulombs per second which we call by the special unit amperes so one coulomb of charge passing through that cross section of wire over one second is equal to one ampere of current ok but wait did you notice that we re talking about positive charge flowing through a wire how can that be after all the current is made up of negatively charged electrons moving through the wire well when american polymath benjamin franklin did experiments with electricity in the s he established what he thought to be the direction in which electricity flows and he named it the positive direction of current it s a convention we still use today it wasn t until much later that we learned the direction franklin chose was actually the opposite of how electrons move in a wire but as far as electric current is concerned the flow of negatively charged electrons in one direction is equivalent to the flow of positively charged particles in the opposite direction while this can be confusing remember that when we talk about the flow of current the convention is to say the current is in the direction that positive charge flows now if you ve ever installed a battery in anything you also know that one terminal of a battery is called positive and the other one is negative and conventionally speaking current flows from the positive to the negative terminal but this means that electrons must flow from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive picture the positive terminal as the start of our river up in the mountains and the negative terminal as the end of the river draining out into the ocean in a river the strength of the water s flow depends on how far the river drops from a high point to a low point and the same is true for electric current and voltage a high voltage typically corresponds to a high current in a circuit but voltage alone doesn t determine how much current flows just like rocks and branches obstruct the passage of water the materials used to conduct electricity have properties that impede the perfect flow of electrons this property is known as resistance and resistance is described in ohms where one ohm of resistance would let one volt of potential generate one ampere of current when resistance is constant voltage is directly proportional to current and this relationship is known as ohm s law this law assumes that the resistance of a material is constant so we can express voltage simply as current times resistance there are substances in which the resistance is not constant and it changes with current or voltage but for many materials -- known as ohmic materials -- ohm s law works quite well now in ohmic materials we can use our new expression of ohm s law to predict and calculate the behavior of a circuit let s say we have a volt battery and we want to know how much current it supplies to a light bulb when we complete the circuit if we know the system has a total resistance of ohms we can divide the battery s voltage by the resistance to find that it has a current of amperes or milliamperes and whether it s a light bulb a speaker system or a supercomputer most electrical devices and materials contain some level of resistance even wires in a circuit have some resistance but compared to the resistance of a connected device like a light bulb it s so minuscule that we typically neglect it but you want to know a neat trick well it doesn t matter because i m going to tell you anyway if you can make certain conductive materials extremely cold you can bring their resistance to zero we call these materials superconductors and trust me when i say that research into these materials is a very important -- and lucrative -- field of study because if you can reduce the resistance of a material by getting rid of that natural loss of energy you can significantly increase the amount of electricity you transmit and in all aspects of engineering efficiency is key now in that spirit i should probably point out here that the whole point of batteries isn t to just push electrons around we need to put those electrons to work for example when we attach a battery to a light bulb we take the potential energy in the battery and turn it into what we need light as current flows through the light bulb the small piece of filament provides resistance which transfers electric energy into thermal energy and light and since we re dealing with energy transformed over time what we really want to know is how much power is used by the bulb power is the amount of energy transformed by a device over time and by transformed i mean the energy is converted from electric energy into some other useful kind of energy like heat or light we ve already learned how to calculate how much energy is in a certain amount of charge that s moving between a difference in potential -- that is the voltage and since charge transferred over time is just current it follows that the power used by the bulb is equal to the current in the circuit times the voltage across the system and just like in our other calculations of power our resulting units are in watts named for scottish inventor james watt this equation holds true for the power used by any electronic device or the power supplied by a battery now anything that consumes power -- from a light bulb to a refrigerator to an entire house -- can be modeled in our equations as a resistor because they create resistance and if you want to find the power that s consumed by a resistor you can substitute ohm s law into the power equation to discover some helpful relationships that hold true for all ohmic materials let s start with the fact that power is a function of current through and voltage across a resistor and ohm s law is about relating voltage current and resistance together so you can either replace the current in the equation and get a new power equation in terms of voltage and resistance or you can replace the voltage and get an expression in terms of only current and resistance this is especially useful when you don t have all the possible information about the circuit so that s your introduction to electric currents they really are just like flowing rivers and once you understand the elegant math behind them they re almost as beautiful today we learned about what defines electric current and how we generate it using voltaic cells that make up batteries we also learned about ohm s law and the relationship between voltage current and resistance finally we discussed what power is and how we measure the power produced and consumed in a circuit crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head over to their channel to check out amazing shows like pbs game show the good bbq with franklin and blank on blank this episode of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'this episode is supported by prudential resistors batteries and capacitors these are just a few of the tools you use to build circuits and provide power to the world around us today we re going to build some basic circuits out of resistors and batteries to figure out how they react and change depending on their configuration for instance in this circuit i ve got a battery connected to a light bulb easy enough right the battery provides a voltage generating a current that runs through the whole circuit lighting up our connected light bulb due to its resistance now what if you have two identical light bulbs in a row how will the current change how bright will each one be and what if instead of two identical light bulbs on the same wire you place the second bulb on its own wire that connects to the battery these are all basic dc or direct current circuits made up of batteries and resistors with current flowing constantly out of the battery in one direction we ll talk about currents that aren t so constant later on but for now everything we deal with will be a dc circuit and hopefully once we re through these bulbs here won t be the only ones lighting up theme music let s start our anatomy of a circuit lesson with our source of energy the battery an ideal battery provides a constant voltage to a circuit powered by its conversion of stored chemical energy to electrical energy scientists say that the battery is a source of electromotive force because it gets charge to move but it s not really providing a force but rather a difference in electrical potential so we shorten this to say that the ideal voltage supplied by the battery is its emf ideally the battery uses all of its voltage to power the devices in a circuit but like most things in real life batteries aren t perfect while a battery s purpose is to provide a steady voltage its inner workings still contain conductive materials that will naturally lose energy as heat like when you watch crash course on your phone for three hours and it gets warm that heat is partly caused by the components inside the battery having resistance and you know that when there s resistance in a flow of current power will be drawn and released often in the form of heat in a circuit you model this effect as an internal resistance between the battery s terminals so when you measure the actual voltage between the terminals of the battery you get a value that s less than our ideal emf potential this real voltage is called the terminal voltage and you calculate the terminal voltage by subtracting the voltage drop due to internal resistance from the supplied emf voltage designated by a script e this internal voltage drop according to ohm s law is equal to the current through the circuit times the internal resistance the internal resistance is typically much smaller than the resistance of any connected devices so the terminal voltage is usually only a little bit less than the emf voltage for example say you have a volt battery with no internal resistance and it s connected in a circuit with a resistor of ohms you can use ohm s law to find that the resulting current is amperes now let s say that the battery has an internal resistance of ohm if you substitute ohm s law into our equation for terminal voltage and solve the equation with both the internal resistance and the resistance of the circuit it s hooked up to you find that the current through the circuit is now amperes compared to the ideal battery it s only a milliampere difference now to find out exactly how much power is lost to the battery s internal resistance you can use the power expression we used in our last lesson power equals current times voltage because that equation shows the rate at which energy is converted from electricity into another form of energy such as heat light or mechanical power but since we don t know the voltage drop across the internal resistance you can use ohm s law and substitute current times resistance for the voltage from this equation you can see that the internal resistance causes the battery to use about milliwatts of power now you might have noticed in this example that while the two resistance values were different the current going throughout the whole circuit was the same when at least two resistors are connected along the same path they re connected in series and any devices connected in series have the same current flowing through them and while all resistors along the same wire have the same current they each have different voltages dropping across them according to the conservation of energy the total voltage supplied to the system is equal to the sum of all the voltage drops across the circuit think of it as a river like we ve done before with each resistor as a group of rocks sitting in the water the current will be the same going through each set of rocks whether it s a pile of large boulders with high resistance or a clump of small pebbles with low resistance since it s much easier for current to go through small pebbles the energy spent going through them is low and for large boulders which offer higher resistance more energy will be lost and this change in potential energy is just like a voltage drop for the same current the voltage drop across greater resistances is higher than the lower voltage drops for the low resistances but let s figure out how to express this mathematically if the voltage supplied by a battery is the equal to the sum of all voltage drops across say three resistors in a series you can substitute ohm s law for each resistor the voltage drop across each resistor is proportional to its resistance also since the current is equal for all of the components you can represent the total resistance of the circuit as the sum of all the resistances in the series this total is called the equivalent resistance now there s another way you can combine resistors in a circuit by splitting one path of current into two or more branches when multiple resistors are configured so the current splits into many branches from a single source they re said to be connected in parallel and in the case of parallel connection you want to pay close attention to the principle known as the conservation of charge this principle states that all current flowing to the junction where the path splits equals all of the current flowing out of the same junction that s to say that what goes in must come out now for each of these branches the amount of current passing through it depends on its respective resistance and since you no longer have a single current throughout your whole circuit charge is not limited to one path so let s think about this again in terms of flowing water if a river breaks off into two different branches and there s one branch with lots of resistance and another with very little where do you think most of the water will go the path of least resistance not all of the water goes down the easy way there s still water that moves through the rocky branch but just not as much and in our hypothetical river both branches no matter how rocky start and end at the same elevation giving them the same potential in terms of electricity this means that for every branch in a parallel connection the voltage is the same no matter what the resistance is so for a series connection the current is the same for all resistors and the voltage drop changes but in a parallel connection the voltage is the same for all resistors and the current through each changes now remember how you add up all the resistances to find an equivalent resistance for resistors in a series would the same be true for a parallel setup let s look at this mathematically to find out conservation of charge says that the current in the wire before the split junction is equal to the current coming out so if we ve got three branches the current goes in three directions we can substitute ohm s law for each current to get an equation in terms of voltage and resistance and since the voltage for each resistor is the same in parallel you can cancel the voltage term out of the entire equation and we re left with the equation for parallel equivalent resistance this shows you that the equivalent resistance for a parallel setup of resistors will actually be smaller than any one of the resistors in the circuit and this kind of makes sense if you think back to our river analogy even if one of the two branches in a river is very clogged up there s still more current flowing through the total system than if that clogged up branch did not exist so any additional branch will serve to decrease the total resistance of the system and increase the amount of current through the entire circuit all right now that we ve learned what series and parallel connections are let s go back to those circuits we talked about at the beginning and see what happens when you connect them for real when you connect a single light bulb to our battery you see how it lights up brightly now what happens when you add an identical light bulb in a series connection since identical light bulbs have identical resistances you know that the resistance in the circuit would be double and this corresponds to a current that s half of what it would be for a single bulb and sure enough once you complete the circuit you can see that the bulbs are less bright than the original single-bulb circuit and if you added more bulbs in series you d see that the brightness would keep decreasing for each additional bulb now let s take our single-bulb circuit and add one bulb in a parallel connection so the current splits into two different branches each with equal resistance now you see that each bulb is the same brightness as the single-bulb circuit so why is that well in this setup the current has an additional but identical path to go through so the overall resistance is half of what it was with a single-wire circuit since the equivalent resistance is half of what it used to be and the voltage hasn t changed the current increases to double its original value but since the current must divide equally into each of the different paths we re left with two bulbs that have the same amount of current flowing through them that the single bulb circuit had this is incredibly useful think about the outlets in your house they re all connected in parallel so no matter how many items are plugged in they all receive the same voltage but what happens when you create circuits that are combinations of series and parallel connections we ve already got the tools to solve most circuit arrangements that you ll encounter so next time we ll look at some key examples mathematically and electrically so don t forget to bring your light bulbs today we learned about batteries and how terminal voltage results from the natural internal resistance of every real battery we discussed both series and parallel circuit configurations and how the laws of conservation affect the current and voltage for each finally we saw how series and parallel connections affect real circuits in our light bulb circuit demonstration

amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'when you study physics you can start to see it everywhere even here as an engineer who studied physics i have to say one the most interesting parts of the holidays is the lights just think of all of the crazy displays that you see and what it would take to figure out the current required to power all of the tiny light bulbs that make them glow so many resistors now i m not going to ask you to diagram the holiday lights on your neighbor s house but one of the best ways to understand how electricity works in a system like that is through circuit analysis the process of breaking down a circuit into its key components and studying each one to see what it can tell you about the others so far you ve learned about the key components of every electrical circuit namely voltage resistance and current these properties are all related to one another through ohm s law this means that if you know two out of the three variables you can solve for the remaining one for example you can take a bunch of resistors in a circuit find their equivalent resistance and then use the voltage to figure out what the current is and when you know the current you can get even more important information like the voltage across a particular component or the current through a specific wire so if nothing else today s lesson in circuit analysis will help you appreciate holiday lights on a whole new level theme music let s keep things simple there s an enormous number of circuit-building methods that i d love to go over with you but we re going to stick to the basics which you ll use in every circuit problem you ll encounter these are dc circuits with resistors in series and parallel formations you ll recall that series formations occur when resistors are connected along the same path so they have the same current passing through each one and parallel connections are when resistors are placed on wires that branch out from a single point all having the same voltage drop across them and to find the equivalent resistance of resistors in series you just add their resistances together for resistors in parallel meanwhile you use a different method one that gives you a resistor with an equivalent resistance that s smaller than any of the individual resistors in the branches now let s put these equations to work here s an example of a circuit with resistors in both series and parallel formations say you have a -volt battery immediately followed by a resistor of ohms following that there s a parallel formation of more resistors one branch consists of two resistors in series one of ohms and one of ohms the other branch has a ohm resistor and then another parallel formation of resistors and ohms each our goal is to simplify everything down to one resistor which will have the equivalent resistance of all of these resistors combined with that equivalent resistance you can then know what the resulting current is in the circuit then using ohm s law you can calculate the voltage across and current through each resistor ok let s do the easiest steps first start by finding the resistors in a series you can collapse these down into a single resistor by simply adding their resistances together in this case you add the and ohm resistors into a single ohm equivalent resistor now that branch contains a single resistor let s look at the other branch this one has a single resistor and then two in parallel so let s start by turning the parallel connection of the ohm and ohm resistors into one equivalent resistor using our equation for resistors in parallel you find that they simplify to a single resistor of about ohms then you can add the newly formed resistor to the ohm one and the branch simplifies even more to a single resistor of ohms all right you re almost there now let s combine the ohm and ohm resistors which are in parallel into one resistor and its resistance turns out to be ohms and with that you re left with only two resistors in series which you can combine to form a single resistor with the equivalent resistance of ohms now there s only one resistor left which means you can easily find the current drawn from the battery using ohm s law you can find that the current through a circuit with a volt battery and an equivalent resistance of ohms is about amperes just pause for a moment and appreciate what you ve done so far you were able to take what you knew about the power source and the number and configuration of the resistors to figure out the current that runs through the circuit and it wasn t that hard was it and now that you ve determined the current you can learn so much more with the total current in the system you can expand the equivalent circuit back to its original form and while you re doing that you can determine both the current through and the voltage drop across every single resistor just go back one step to the ten ohm resistor and the ohm resistor nothing has changed about the current through the circuit and the two resistors are in series so the current flowing through them is the same but the voltage drop across each resistor is different you can calculate the voltage drop across each resistor by using ohm s law v equals i times r you know the current i and you know each resistance r so you simply use them to find the distinct voltage drop v across each resistor the voltage drop across the ohm resistor turns out to be volts which leaves the remaining voltage drop across the rest of the circuit to be volts and you don t have to do anything with the ohm resistor since that s not a combination of resistors so the current through and voltage across that circuit element doesn t change in order to complete the rest of the circuit let s expand the ohm resistor back out again to those two resistors in parallel now you know that any two resistors in parallel have the same voltage drop so both the ohm resistor and the ohm resistor have a voltage drop of volts just when they were collapsed into one but the current through each branch is not the same since you know the resistance of and voltage across each resistor you just use ohm s law again to calculate the current through each wire the ohm resistor with a voltage drop of volts will have a current of amperes and the ohm resistor with the same voltage drop of volts will have a current of amperes and look at this if you add these two currents together they equal the amperes that s the same value for the current that enters the junction where the wires split this must be true to satisfy conservation of charge because remember what goes in must come out now let s expand the resistor on the right into its two components a ohm and a ohm resistor the current through these two is still amperes but the voltage drop of volts is now split across the two resistors all you have to do is implement ohm s law yet again multiplying current and resistance in order to find the voltage drop so amperes times ohms equals a volt drop and amperes times ohms equals the remaining volt drop now it s good to check that you re on the right track by looking at the relationships of all of these values keep in mind that for resistors in series the larger the resistance is the larger the voltage drop that s required think of a big light bulb and a tiny light bulb on the same wire of holiday lights using the same current the little light bulb doesn t draw nearly as much power so it uses less voltage for the same amount of current passing through it ok back to work our ohm resistor is a combination of a ohm and ohm pair of resistors in parallel so the voltage drop across each resistor is still volts but the current passing through each will be different using ohm s law you can divide the voltage across each resistor by its respective resistance giving you the current through each branch volts divided by ohms gives you a current of amperes through the ohm resistor and volts divided by ohms gives you a current of amperes and since plus amperes equals the amperes that enters the wire at the split you know you re on the right track one last step the ohm resistor is a series combination of a ohm and ohm resistor here the current through them amperes stays the same while the voltage drop across each one can be found using ohm s law amperes times ohms equals volts across the ohm resistor and amperes times ohms equals the remaining volts across the ohm resistor to check your work you can go back and see that the two voltage drops equal the total voltage drop across each branch after the ohm resistor and you ve done it congrats you ve taken a whole circuit simplified it down to the bare minimum then expanded it again discovering the current and voltage values for every single resistor but even though we all love math what if that s not enough for you what if you physically constructed this circuit yourself and you wanted to measure the values so that you knew your math checked out to measure voltage you d just need a tool known as a voltmeter pretty creative i know now you want a way to measure voltage without altering the actual circuit no solution is perfect but you can get a pretty accurate reading by attaching the voltmeter on either side of the device that you want to measure and you do it that way because you know that any components connected in parallel will have the same voltage but even if you measure the voltage you still want to avoid changing the resulting circuit so what you do is give the voltmeter a resistance that s so high that it s considered infinite relative to the rest of the circuit with an infinite resistance the same voltage is read across both the voltmeter and the device you re measuring and a tiny amount of current ends up running through the voltmeter ok you re a stickler and even though you ve confirmed your voltage you want to do the same thing with the current this time you ll use the fact that devices connected in series share the same current so you need a device that can measure current in series with another component without changing the current this is known as an ammeter and it measures the current in amperes by connecting in series with the circuit it doesn t affect the circuit because the device has a near-zero resistance but here s a pro tip when you use these devices in the lab be very careful not to mix up the methods of connection attaching the ammeter a device with near-zero resistance in parallel with another resistor will cause nearly all the current to run through the ammeter possibly damaging it and if a voltmeter is attached in series you re not going to see any current flowing because the resistance is so large but used correctly these devices can not only allow you to confirm your maths they can also give you a hands-on way to measure the basic principles of ohm s law in action and they just might help you raise your holiday-lighting game to a whole new level today we saw how circuit analysis can be used on any series and parallel configuration of resistors in a dc circuit we used ohm s law to go from an equivalent circuit to solving for every current value and voltage drop in the system finally we saw how to measure voltage and current in a real circuit using voltmeters and ammeters crash

indie alaska this episode of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'this episode is supported by prudential by now thanks to our lesson on circuit analysis and previous crash course physics episodes you know your way around a basic dc circuit you ve learned how to simplify circuits with resistors connected in series and parallel with a single battery source which is great but a lot of the real-world circuits that you encounter and will have to describe are much more complicated for example what happens when there are multiple batteries connected in parallel and what happens when we add capacitors into the mix with resistors in our dc circuits on this our last go-round inside a dc circuit we ll encounter junctions loops and capacitors theme music circuits aren t always just a battery powering a set of resistors the design of a circuit depends on the needs of the system it operates and we need tools to take any configuration into account in the mid th century a german physicist named gustav kirchhoff expanded on the principles of ohm s law to improve our ability to calculate current and voltage in complex electrical circuits kirchhoff took laws we already knew the conservation of charge and of energy and established two rules for circuit analysis the first rule which deals with conservation of charge is something we ve actually already discussed it s known as kirchhoff s junction rule and it states that the sum of all currents entering into a junction is equal to the sum of all currents leaving the junction like i ve been saying what goes in must come out the second rule based on the conservation of energy is a little harder to grasp but trust me it works it s kirchhoff s loop rule and it says that the sum of all changes in potential around a loop equals zero so why would you need to know that s a thing well remember batteries supply potential and then that potential also called voltage drops across resistors it s kind of like a ride on a roller coaster you may climb up steep slopes and fly around the track doing loop-da-loops to your heart s content and your stomach s discontent but you always start and end in the same place likewise in a circuit every battery is like a climb in height gaining potential and each resistor is a drop but no matter which way you go in the circuit you ll always end up where you started so let s put these rules to the test here s a circuit that wouldn t be easy to solve with only ohm s law it has two batteries and four resistors with a combination of series and parallel connections you can simplify the two resistors in series down to one but after that how do you tackle the rest if you want to find the current through each branch and the voltage drop across each resistor you re gonna need gustav s help the first step of using the junction rule is to label all the junctions each junction is a point on a wire that s connected to two or more circuit elements then you label all the different currents in the diagram there are only three different wire branches so there are three different currents in the circuit kirchhoff s junction rule tells us that everything entering junction a must leave it too mathematically this means that i is equal to the sum of i and i since it s i that splits off into two branches notice by the way that we ve assigned the current directions the way we have because they make sense with the orientation of the batteries going from the negative to positive terminal but no matter which way you orient them in your equations all the values will work out the same way if you ve correctly chosen the direction of current then their values will come out positive like current should but if you ve chosen the wrong direction then the value will end up being negative ok back to the action let s call the equation with the current values equation one and return to it later when we need it now it s time to try out kirchhoff s loop rule you can draw a loop around any part of the circuit where you can imagine a charged particle moving around the circuit in a circle ending back where it started to put it simply wherever there s a loop we can use the loop rule we ve got one loop in the top half of the circuit and a second loop in the bottom half and there s actually a third loop here too it s the entire outside of the circuit now you ve got your loops and you re going to use them to solve the three unknown current values let s begin with loop number one in this loop you have one volt battery and two resistors a ohm and a ohm one you know that there s a voltage gain across the battery and a voltage drop across both resistor and resistor the voltage gain across the battery is volts but you don t know the voltage drops across the resistors thanks to ohm s law you can substitute the voltage drop across each resistor with the current times the resistance now you ve got two unknowns in this equation which we ll call equation two let s set that aside as well next let s look at loop two in this loop you ve got two batteries and three resistors if you follow the direction of the loop you see that both batteries add voltage because the loop direction goes from their negative end through to the positive end additionally all the resistors will subtract voltage because the loop goes in the same direction as the current so it s important to draw your current directions first in order to make this clear now you want to do the same thing you did for the first loop which is to sum up all the changes in voltage to and then you just substitute ohm s law in for every resistor s voltage to get terms of current and resistance now you have this third equation which we ll call equation three while you could go on and create an equation for the third loop you actually don t need to because the junction rule gives you an equation to use here so at this point you have the three equations you need to solve everything so let s first revisit equation one and replace i and i with equations two and three now you have an equation entirely in terms of i which you can solve to find that i is equal to ampere once you have this value you can easily solve equations two and three by substituting in the new i solution and there you go if you wanted to know any of the voltage drops across the resistors all you d have to do is multiply the resistance in question by the current passing through that resistor for instance the voltage drop across resistor would be the resistance ohms multiplied by the current passing through that resistor which is ampere that s a total voltage drop of volts and the drop across resistor in the same loop would be the resistance ohms times the current through the resistor which is amperes that comes out to a voltage drop of volts which makes sense because then the sum of each drop in the loop is equal to the voltage supplied by the battery and those are kirchhoff s laws the junction rule for current and the loop rule for voltage with a little ohm s law utilization as well now it s time to reintroduce our old friend the capacitor in a dc circuit a capacitor is useful for storing charge temporarily then releasing it again later on but so far we ve been dealing with circuits that have a constant flow of charge or those that have reached steady state with capacitors we deal with transient conditions or circuit responses that change with time from our earlier lessons you know that the amount of charge stored in a capacitor is equal to the voltage across the capacitor times its capacitance and you can store this charge by connecting a capacitor in series with a battery letting current flow from the battery into the capacitor until the capacitor s voltage is equal to the battery s but what happens when you connect multiple capacitors together like we do with resistors in series and in parallel well if you have several capacitors connected in parallel the overall capacitance of the circuit increases in this circuit diagram we have three capacitors connected in parallel with a single battery current will flow into the capacitors and will stop when each capacitor holds the maximum amount of charge so how can you describe the equivalent capacitance of a circuit like this easy the total amount of charge is the sum of the charges held by each individual capacitor and you know that the charge held by each capacitor is equal to the capacitance times the voltage across each one and since every point of a conductor has the same potential and all the conductors are connected all devices connected in parallel will have the same voltage so you can simplify the charge equation to say that the equivalent capacitance of the circuit is equal to the sum of all the individual capacitances note that this is the not the same as the parallel equation for resistors capacitance is unique in this way in fact the convention is also reversed for capacitors connected in series which will have a lower overall capacitance for example if you have a circuit with three capacitors connected in series with a single battery then the current still stops flowing when the total voltage across the capacitors equals that of the battery the charge contained by each capacitor is the same because current can t flow through the capacitors only on either side of them so if one plate of the first capacitor has a positive charge then the other plate in that first capacitor has an equal and opposite negative charge this leads the plate of the next capacitor to have an equal and opposite positive charge since the amount of charge in the plates and the wire that connects them hasn t changed but the nearby charged plate redistributes the charge to compensate this effect carries all the way through until the last plate of the third capacitor has a negative charge equal and opposite to the first capacitor s positive plate so you can picture the entire set of capacitors as one big equivalent capacitor for devices in series the voltage drops across each element equal the voltage provided by the battery so to find the equivalent capacitance in this case just substitute in the charge equation voltage-times-capacitance for each voltage across the capacitors the charge contained by each capacitor is still the same since the charge on each positive and negative plate is the same for each capacitor therefore you can factor out charge and you re left with the equation for equivalent capacitance of capacitors connected in series so for series capacitors the combined capacitance is less than the weakest individual capacitor and guess what this wraps up our review of electricity now all that s left to learn about is the other side of this same force the realm of magnetism today we learned about kirchhoff s laws and how we can rework conservation of charge and of energy to analyze more complex circuits we also discussed how capacitors function in a typical dc circuit and the ways they behave when combined in series and parallel connections thanks to prudential for sponsoring this episode the time between when people think they should start saving for retirement and when they actually do is known as the action gap

studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'this episode is supported by prudential so it s friday april a physics professor in denmark named hans christian oersted is in the middle of a lecture and he s using a compass and an electric wire for a demonstration he turns on the current that runs through the wire and he notices that the needle in the compass starts to move and when he turns the current off the needle moves back to where it was then he runs the current through the wire in the opposite direction and sees the needle move the other way what oersted demonstrated that day was a fundamental discovery the connection between electricity and magnetism and it changed the field of physics forever the relationship between electricity and magnetism not only explains what oersted and his students witnessed in it also makes possible much of the technology that s used today from hydroelectric dams to your smartphone it even explains why earth s magnetic field is essentially keeping you from being cooked alive right now and all you really need to understand the basics of magnetism and electricity is this waves hand theme music you re probably familiar with the basics of magnets already they have a north pole and south pole two of the same pole will repel each other while opposites attract only certain materials especially those that contain iron can be magnets it depends on their molecular properties and other metals including cobalt nickel and iron are attracted to magnets even though they aren t magnets themselves like the metal in your refrigerator door and there s a magnetic field around earth which is why you can use a compass to figure out which way is north the magnet in the compass aligns itself with earth s magnetic field just as we use electric field lines to represent the electric field created by charges we can draw magnetic field lines to represent the magnetic field created by magnets and as with electric fields the more crowded the lines are the stronger the magnetic field the lines point from the north pole to the south pole like how electric field lines point from the positive to the negative charge but there s a key difference you can have an electric field spreading outward from a single electric charge but that can t happen with magnets because you can t isolate one magnetic pole if you chop a bar magnet in half you don t end up with one north magnet and one south magnet you end up with two magnets each with its own north pole and south pole this means that the magnetic field lines surrounding a magnet always form closed loops we measure magnetic fields using a unit called the tesla which is one newton per ampere-meter and tesla is a very strong magnetic field the fields from some of the strongest superconducting magnets in the world are only teslas now when oersted was doing his demonstration on that fateful day in he was using a regular compass magnet but when he brought the magnet close to a wire carrying a current the magnetic field from that current exerted a force on the needle moving it to point in a different direction oersted had discovered one of the fundamental principles of electromagnetism an electric current produces a magnetic field after a few more months of experimenting oersted figured out that when a current runs through a wire the magnetic field that it produces surrounds the wire expressed with field lines the magnetic field would appear as circles with the wire at their center if the current was coming straight towards you the field lines would be pointing counterclockwise and we use the vector b to represent the magnetic field the magnitude of the vector is the strength of the magnetic field and the direction of the vector is the field s direction now there s an easy way to remember how the direction of the electric current and the direction of the magnetic field it produces relate to each other it s called the first right-hand rule because there are actually three right-hand rules just take your right hand and point your thumb in the direction of the electric current now curl your fingers the direction your fingers are curling that s the way the magnetic field lines are pointing and likewise if you know the direction of the magnetic field lines you can use the rule to figure out the direction of the current in the wire it really comes in uh handy now if a current running through a wire exerts a force on a magnet you might expect the opposite to be true as well that a magnet exerts a force on a current running through a wire and it does which is good because that s what s protecting us from harmful radiation from the sun right now the direction of the force from a magnetic field on a current running through a wire will be perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current which brings us to the second right-hand rule this one helps you keep track of three directions the direction of the magnetic field the current and the force here s how to use the second right-hand rule point your arm in the direction of the current then bend your fingers so they re perpendicular to your palm this represents the direction of the magnetic field your thumb which is perpendicular to your fingers is the direction of the force on the wire but what about the strength of that force you can use your hands to figure this out too but you ll have to use them to do math sorry the magnitude of the force from a magnetic field on a wire is equal to i l b sin theta this equation tells us that there are four factors that affect the magnitude of the force first there s the current in the wire that s i and the stronger it is the stronger the force is second there s the length of the wire running through the magnetic field that s l and the longer the wire is the stronger the force is third there s the magnetic field b and the stronger b is the stronger the force finally the closer to perpendicular the current is with respect to the magnetic field s direction the stronger the force is that s where the sine theta comes in its maximum value is when theta is degrees so the current is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines that s when the force will be strongest similarly the minimum value of sine theta is when theta is so that means the current is parallel to the magnetic field lines and in that case there won t be any force on the wire at all now all of this math can help us understand how we re being protected right now from solar radiation the sun is constantly shooting radiation towards earth in the form of charged particles but luckily for us earth has a magnetic field currents are made up of moving electric charges so it makes sense that a magnetic field would also exert a force on single electric charges that pass through it and this is exactly what the earth s magnetic field does to the charged particles coming from the sun it deflects them sending them spiraling away and protecting us from the worst of the radiation let s suppose you wanted to find the magnitude of the force of the magnetic field on a single charged particle from the sun all you d have to do is change the equation we used for the force on the current to account for the fact that we re talking about a single charge the equation for the force of a magnetic field on a current says that the strength of the force is equal to the current times the length of the wire times the strength of the magnetic field times the sine of the angle between the current and the magnetic field now two of those variables don t apply to a single charge the current i and the length l but current is just equal to the number of charged particles passing a given point over a certain amount of time which we ll call n times their charge q divided by that time t for a single charge n is just and length is just equal to velocity v multiplied by time so we can apply these two facts to our equation for force which tells us that the force on an electric charge moving through a magnetic field is equal to q divided by time multiplied by velocity times time times the strength of the magnetic field times the sine of theta those two t s cancel each other out so the equation simplifies to f qvbsintheta that means that like the force on a current running through a wire the force on a single electric charge depends on four factors one is the same as with a current the stronger the magnetic field the stronger the force the other three factors are slightly different from the case with a current first the force is stronger the closer to perpendicular the charge s velocity is to the magnetic field lines which means that if the charge s velocity is parallel to the magnetic field lines there won t be any force on whatsoever second the more charge the particle has the stronger the force and third the faster the particle is moving the stronger the force finding the direction of this force is where the third right-hand rule comes in so get your right hand out again straighten your fingers with your thumb stretched outward then point your arm in the direction of the particle s velocity then bend your fingers to make them point in the direction of the magnetic field lines this is where things get a little tricky if the charged particle is positive your thumb is pointing in the direction of the force but if it s negative the force is pointing in the direction opposite your thumb so electric currents create magnetic fields and magnetic fields exert forces on electric currents and charges oersted s experiment was simple but his discovery linked two major fields of physics and inspired other scientists to do a lot more experimenting today you learned about magnetism and the magnetic field created by a current running through a wire we also talked about the force from a magnetic field on a current running through a wire and on a single charge moving through a magnetic field and we went through the three right-hand rules thanks to prudential for sponsoring this episode saving a little more today even just more of your annual

experimenting with some wires trying to learn more about the connection between currents and the magnetic fields they create he took two parallel wires ran a current through both of them in the same direction and the wires attracted each other and when he ran a current through both wires in the opposite directions the wires repelled each other studying this strange force between the wires led amp re to discover one of the most fundamental laws of electromagnetism what we now call amp re s law and that s not the only weird thing that current-carrying wires do if you wrap a current-carrying wire into a coil the inside of the coil acts like a magnet there s a north pole at one end of the coil and a south pole at the other and if you put a loop of current-carrying wire in a magnetic field it ll turn amp re s law lets you calculate the strength of the currents and magnetic fields in all these situations this also helps explain how motors work theme music so first those two parallel wires why do they attract and repel each other it s easier to see why the two wires act the way they do if you look at one wire first like we talked about in our last episode the current running through a wire generates a magnetic field so let s say you have a long straight wire with a current running through it the current will create a magnetic field circling the wire that magnetic field decreases the further you are from the wire if you draw a circle that s say a centimeter from the wire the magnetic field along the circle will have a set strength amp re realized that the stronger the current is that s running through the wire the stronger the magnetic field would be along that circle that s the basic logic behind amp re s law but this is physics and in physics we tend to express relationships in terms of equations the equation for amp re s law applies to any kind of loop not just a circle surrounding a current no matter how many wires there are or how they re arranged or shaped the law is valid as long as the current is constant the equation itself says that the integral of the magnetic field b along the loop times the cosine of theta with respect to distance is equal to a constant called mu multiplied by the current running through the loop this equation just means that the total magnetic field along the loop is equal to the current running through the loop times a constant number the constant mu is sometimes called the magnetic constant and it s equal to times pi times to the - th newtons per amperes squared now you may have noticed that there s an integral on the left-hand side of the equation for ampere s law and you might remember that we use integrals when we need to add up lots of infinitely tiny values well in amp re s law we re adding up all the little bits of magnetic field along the loop we re saying that all those bits of magnetic field added together are equal to the enclosed current times the magnetic constant b is the strength of the magnetic field at each point along the loop theta is the angle between the magnetic field and each point on the loop and ds is referring to each infinitely tiny section of the loop the mathematics of amp re s law can get very complicated very quickly but to get a basic sense of how it works let s return to our scenario a circle around one long straight wire we re trying to find the magnetic field at each point on the circle that s b in terms of the enclosed current and the radius of the circle so first let s solve the integral in amp re s law to get the total magnetic field along the circle according to the law we re solving the integral of the magnetic field times the cosine of theta with respect to the points along the circle but we can simplify this integral pretty easily first you ll notice that the magnetic field coming from our wire is parallel to the circle at every point so the angle theta is and the cosine of is anything times is equal to itself so we can just knock the cosine of theta term out of the integral now we re left with the integral of the magnetic field b with respect to the points along the circle but every part of the circle is the exact same distance from the wire so the magnetic field will be the same at every point in other words b is constant so we can move it in front of the integral sign now all we need to do is figure out the integral of all the points along the circle which is equal to the circumference of the circle so times pi times the radius putting that all together we find that when we apply amp re s law to a long straight wire the total magnetic field along a circle surrounding a wire is equal to b times times pi times the radius and that total magnetic field is equal to the magnetic constant times the enclosed current so for a long straight wire b is equal to the magnetic constant times the enclosed current divided by pi r the equation for the magnetic field along a circle surrounding one wire turned out to be really important for amp re when he was trying to figure out what was going on with two wires when both wires had current running through them in the same direction they attracted each other and when the current was going in opposite directions they repelled each other it s easy to see why if you apply the first right-hand rule that s the one that says if you point your right thumb in the direction of a current and curl your fingers the magnetic field points in the same direction as your fingers so first let s look at the wires with currents running in the same direction for this example we ll say that they re vertical wires with the current flowing upward if you point your right thumb in the direction of the current in each wire your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field the magnetic field from the wire on the left will be pointing to the right and the magnetic field from the wire on the right will be pointing to the left so the wires will attract each other for the case where the current is flowing in opposite directions the reverse is true so they ll repel each other now ampere also wanted to find the force from the magnetic field on the wires like we talked about last time the force depends on the angle between the current and the magnetic field the strength of the current the length of the wire and the strength of the magnetic field calculating that magnetic field b was the tricky part but the equation he came up with the one that we now call ampere s law allowed him and future physicists to figure out what b was in a lot of situations including the case of the two parallel wires so the two parallel wires attracted and repelled each other because of the magnetic field created by the current what about the coil of wire that turned into a magnet well you can probably guess that its behavior also has to do with the magnetic field produced by a current see that coil of wire is a special shape called a solenoid and when a solenoid has a current running through it it produces a magnetic field basically all of which goes through the inside of the coils if you curl your right hand around the solenoid so that your fingers point in the direction of the current running through the loops your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field amp re s law is useful for solenoids too it says that the magnetic field inside the coils b is equal to the magnetic constant times the current running through the coils times the number of coils so that s what happens when loops of wire create a magnetic field when you stick a loop of wire in a magnetic field something a little stranger happens the loop of wire turns that s because the magnetic field creates a torque on the wire take a look at this loop of wire the horizontal parts of the loop are parallel to the magnetic field so it won t exert a force on them but the vertical parts of the loop are perpendicular to the magnetic field so it will exert a force on them a force that turns the loop from the last episode we know that the force from the magnetic field on the wire will be equal to the current times the length of that part of the coil times the magnetic field and we can use the second right-hand rule to figure out the direction of that force if you point your hand in the direction of the current then bend your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field your thumb will point in the direction of the force which turns out to be away from you for the left-hand side of the coil and toward you for the right-hand side so the coil turns clockwise this is how electric motors work they have an electric current that continuously flips directions making loops of wire spin those moving loops of wire can be used to do mechanical work like turning the drum in your washing machine or your power drill or the fan that probably cools your computer there are electric motors all over the place so the next time you wash your clothes or put together some furniture or use your computer without it overheating or do anything else that involves an electric motor you have amp re to thank today you learned about amp re s law and how it applies to a long straight wire we also talked about the forces between two parallel wires and the magnetic field created by a solenoid finally we described the torque on a current loop crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head over to their channel and check out a playlist of the latest episodes from shows like gross science pbs idea channel and it s okay to be smart this episode of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'this episode is supported by prudential physicists learned a lot about electricity and magnetism in the th century we ve already talked about one of the biggest discoveries that electric currents can create magnetic fields and once scientists had figured that out they wondered if the opposite was also true could magnetic fields create or induce an electric current many physicists designed experiments to detect electric currents induced by magnetic fields but they kept coming up empty that is until two physicists joseph henry and michael faraday both on their own figured out what was happening it turns out that magnetic fields do induce electric currents but only under certain circumstances when the magnetic field is changing with time and this discovery is what eventually led to the invention of hard drives theme music when faraday discovered that magnetic fields induce electric currents he got kind of lucky he set up a current flowing through a coil of wire so that it would generate a magnetic field and then he watched to see if that magnetic field induced a current in a second coil of wire and it didn t which was probably pretty disappointing at first but then faraday noticed something weird when he turned the current on and off in the first coil there was a brief spike of current in the second coil but only while the current was changing from off to on and back again he realized that he d been looking for the wrong thing a constant magnetic field didn t cause an electric current in a loop of wire only a changing magnetic field did these days we call this idea faraday s law of induction it says that a changing magnetic field will induce an emf in a loop of wire and emf you ll recall stands for electromotive force which is what causes electrons to move and form a current so now faraday knew that when a magnetic field changed over time it induced an emf in a loop of wire but a couple of other things induced emf too even if the strength of the magnetic field stayed the same changing the area of the loop of wire induced a current too and so did changing the angle between the loop and the magnetic field that s because of a property that most directly induces emf the property known as magnetic flux represented by b magnetic flux is essentially a measure of the magnetic field running through a loop of wire and when that field changes that s what induces an emf and there are three factors that affect the magnetic field and therefore the magnetic flux through the loop first there s the strength of the magnetic field which we label as b next there the area of the loop a if the loop is bigger there ll be a larger magnetic field running through it and vice versa and finally there s the angle theta between the magnetic field and a line perpendicular to the face of the loop combining all these factors we find that the magnetic flux is equal to the strength of the magnetic field times the area of the loop times the cosine of the angle between the magnetic field and that perpendicular line and if the magnetic field and the loop are perpendicular then the magnetic flux will just be equal to the strength of the magnetic field times the area of the loop magnetic flux is measured in units of tm also known as webers but when it comes to inducing emf what really matters is how the flux is changing over time if the magnetic flux through a loop of wire decreases over time the emf increases accordingly and if the flux increases over time the emf decreases in maths terms we d say that the emf is equal to the negative of the change in flux over the change in time this equation works well for the change in flux through one loop of wire but often you ll be inducing emf in a coil of wire like what faraday was doing in his experiment so it helps to know how a change in the magnetic flux will induce emf in a coil and the key here is that a change in the magnetic flux through a coil induces the same emf in each loop of the coil so if you want to know the total emf in the coil you calculate the emf for one loop of wire then multiply it by the number of loops in the coil or n which means that the induced emf in a coil of wire is equal to the number of coils times the change in magnetic flux over the change in time all multiplied by a negative sign so having two loops in the coil would mean double the emf that would be induced in one loop while loops would mean times the emf so faraday s law of induction lets us calculate how much emf and therefore how much current will be induced in a loop of wire by a change in magnetic flux but in what direction will the induced current flow to figure that out we use a rule called lenz s law you know how currents generate magnetic fields well lenz s law says that the magnetic field generated by the induced current will be in the direction opposite the change magnetic flux so if you know the direction of the change in magnetic flux you can figure out the direction of the magnetic field generated by the current and from there you can use our old friend the right-hand rule to figure out the direction of the current to get a better feel for how to apply lenz s law let s look at two scenarios involving a bar magnet below a loop of wire with the north pole of the magnet facing the loop in the first scenario you move the north pole of the bar magnet closer to the loop which increases the magnetic field flowing through the loop this therefore creates a change in magnetic flux and induces a current in the loop and the current generates a magnetic field that opposes this change in magnetic flux now the north pole of the magnet points in the same direction as the magnetic field so by moving the magnet closer to the loop you essentially made the magnetic field from the bar magnet point more strongly upward and according to lenz s law the magnetic field created by the induced current will oppose this so it ll point downward in the second scenario the north pole of the magnet is again facing the wire but this time you move the magnet away from the loop in this case you re basically making the magnetic field from the magnet point less strongly upward and more strongly downward so the magnetic field created by the induced current will point upward to counteract this change and once you know the direction of the magnetic field generated by the induced current you can figure out the direction of the current from there this is where the right-hand rule comes in make a quot stop quot sign with your right hand then point your thumb in the direction of the magnetic field being generated by the induced current the direction that your fingers are pointing that s the direction of the current let s try it in our first scenario where we moved the north pole of the magnet closer to the loop of wire the generated magnetic field was pointing upward so the current will be moving clockwise along the loop in the second scenario where we moved the north pole of the magnet away from the loop the generated magnetic field was pointing downward so the current will be moving counterclockwise along the loop now another way to use magnetic flux to induce a current in a loop is by changing how much of the loop is within the magnetic field say you have a horizontal magnetic field and a loop of wire you arrange the loop so it s perpendicular to the magnetic field then drag it out of the magnetic field which decreases the amount of magnetic field within the loop the magnetic flux through the loop changes which induces an emf the strength of the emf is equal to negative of the change in the magnetic flux over the change in time the flux you ll recall is equal to the magnetic field times the area times the cosine of the angle between the magnetic field and a line perpendicular to the loop since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the loop the cosine of the angle is so that term drops out of the equation which means that in this case the change in flux is equal to the magnetic field times the change in the area of the loop within the magnetic field and the area of the loop is equal to its length which we ll call l times the width of the loop that s in the magnetic field which we ll call x as you move the loop out of the magnetic field the amount of its width within the field x changes so the change in magnetic flux is equal to the strength of the magnetic field times the length of the loop times the change in its width within the magnetic field so the strength of the induced emf will be equal to all of that divided by the change in time thankfully there s a way to simplify all of this the change in x over the change in time should look familiar it s just equal to the velocity of the loop as you move it out of the magnetic field so when you move a loop of wire in or out of a magnetic field the strength of the induced emf is equal to the strength of the magnetic field times the length of the loop times the velocity of the loop using a magnetic field to induce a current is useful for all kinds of reasons we ll talk about some of the main ones next time it s also how hard drives work at least the ones that use a rotating disk your computer stores information on your hard drive by magnetizing small sections of the disk to read that information your computer rotates sections of the disk past the head which is a small electromagnet that has a coil of wire the changing magnetic field induces a current in the coil in the head and computers processes that signal as the zeroes and ones we use to store digital information digital information like this episode of crash course today you learned about magnetic flux and how a change in magnetic flux can induce an emf in a loop or coil of wire we also talked about how to calculate that emf both when the magnetic field is changing and when the area of the loop in the magnetic field is changing finally we described how induction works in hard drives thanks to prudential for sponsoring

people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'wherever you are right now there s probably an electrical outlet within easy reach whether you want to vacuum the living room or recharge your phone all you have to do is plug into the wall and bam instant access to electricity but have you ever wondered how all of that electrical power gets to your house school or office in the first place there are a lot of steps but two of the most important ones involve electric generators and transformers and both of these devices work because of a concept we introduced last time induction theme music electric generators are like the opposite of electric motors motors take electrical energy so the current running through a coil of wire and convert it into mechanical energy as the motor turns generators on the other hand take mechanical energy the rotation of a coil of wire and use induction to convert it into electrical energy in the form of a current running through a wire generators use a wire wound around something called an armature basically a cylinder that rotates within a uniform magnetic field as the loop rotates the changing magnetic flux induces a current in the loops of the coil but the angle that the coil makes with respect to the magnetic field keeps changing which causes the direction of the induced current to reverse itself at every half-turn so the magnetic field in the generator stays constant but because the coil is rotating the angle between the coil and the magnetic field changes this means that the magnetic flux through the loops in the coil changes over time which is what induces an emf and as we ll soon see the emf depends on the sine of the angle between the coil and the magnetic field so for half of the rotation the sine of the angle is positive and for the other half the sine of the angle is negative when it s positive the current flows in one direction when it s negative it flows in the other this means that the direction of the current flips with every half-rotation this produces a type of flow of electricity known as alternating current or ac until now we ve mainly been talking about dc or direct current there are dc generators which include special parts to make the current keep flowing in the same direction the whole time instead of reversing itself as the coil turns but ac power is the kind that flows from the outlets in your walls and in most places in the world it reverses itself either or times per second this is called the frequency of the current and you ll normally see it written in hertz now we can calculate the strength of the emf in a generator using some of the principles we talked about last time we ve already described what happens when you move a loop of wire in or out of a magnetic field the emf induced in the wire is equal to the strength of the magnetic field times the length of the loop times its perpendicular velocity in other words it s the velocity times the sine of the angle between the magnetic field and the loop and the same idea applies to a coil of wire rotating in a magnetic field too we just have to replace some of the variables with ones that apply to a rotating coil first instead of the length of the loop we ll use the area of one loop of the coil a and instead of translational velocity we ll use angular velocity next the angle theta is just equal to the angular velocity multiplied by time and finally instead of finding the emf in just one loop of wire we re finding the emf in a whole coil of wire which means that we need to multiply this equation by n the number of loops in the coil so the emf induced in a coil rotating in a magnetic field is equal to the number of loops in the coil times the strength of the magnetic field times the area of a loop of the coil times the angular velocity times the sine of the angular velocity multiplied by time it s a bit of a mouthful but that s because there are so many factors that affect the emf induced in the coil basically the equation is saying that you ll have a greater induced current in the generator if there are more coils in the wire or if there s a stronger magnetic field or if each loop of the coil is bigger or if it rotates faster now it might seem kind of strange to have a generator produce a current that reverses itself dozens of times a second but actually this is incredibly useful that s because another important device that gets electricity from the power plant to your house is a transformer which is made up of two coils of wire and transformers only work with ac power they re necessary because one of the problems with transmitting electricity over long distances is that if the voltage is low a lot of power gets wasted as heat we re talking like in some cases which is a huge waste of energy when electricity is transmitted at higher voltages though much less power gets wasted as heat that s because for the same power a lower voltage translates to a higher current and power loss increases proportionally to the square of the current in other words if you double the voltage you end up with only a quarter the power loss you had before and if you triple the voltage you get a ninth of the power loss so it s worth transmitting electricity at very high voltages but then you need a way to change the voltage of the electricity running through the lines from its original voltage from the generator which could be around volts then up to a very high voltage as it travels long distances which might be as high as volts that s definitely not safe to use in your household appliances so once the electricity gets to where it needs to go you need to lower its voltage again in the us the power coming out of your wall is volts and in most other places it s volts all those voltage changes are made using transformers which take advantage of something called mutual inductance where a change in the current in one coil leads to a change in emf in another nearby coil and emf is the same thing as voltage this change happens because the changing current in the first coil produces a changing magnetic field so the magnetic flux through the second coil changes which induces an emf and the emf induced in the second coil will be equal to the change in current in the first coil divided by the change in time and multiplied by a constant m m depends on things like the size and shape of the coils and how they re positioned relative to each other this works in the opposite direction too a change in current in the second coil will induce a corresponding emf in the first coil in transformers the power running through the first coil is ac which means the current and the magnetic field it produces are constantly changing so an emf is induced in the second coil but if the second coil has more turns than the first it ll have a higher voltage and vice versa here s why faraday s law which we talked about last time says that the emf or voltage in each coil is equal to the number of loops in the coil times the change in magnetic flux over time we can write this out as an equation for each coil separately using a subscript p for the primary coil and a subscript s for the secondary coil now we want to know how the voltage in the secondary coil compares to the voltage of the primary one to find out we divide the voltage in the secondary coil by the voltage in the primary coil the change in magnetic flux over time cancels out which leaves us with a simple but useful equation the voltage in the secondary coil divided by the voltage in the primary coil is equal to the number of loops in the secondary coil divided by the number of loops in the primary coil so if the secondary coil has twice as many loops as the primary coil it ll have twice as much voltage and if it has triple the loops it ll have triple the voltage and so on if the secondary coil has more loops than the primary coil so that it increases the voltage that s called a step-up transformer and if it has fewer loops than the primary coil so it decreases the voltage that s a step-down transformer as the electricity in power lines travels from the power plant to your house it goes through lots of step-up and step-down transformers if you ve ever seen a tesla coil in action that s just a fancy version of a step-up transformer the secondary coil is designed so that it shoots out bursts of electricity that look like lightning bolts mutual inductance is also used in lots of other things too like wireless chargers for example lots of cell phones have a wireless charging feature where you just put the phone on top of a charging pad and it charges no need to plug anything in it works because there s a coil inside the charging pad and another one inside your phone the ac power running through the charging pad induces an emf in your phone s coil which can use the energy to charge its battery so the same technology that helps get electricity to the outlets in your wall can move power from one device to another even if there are no physical connections between them today you learned about how electricity is produced and transmitted we explained how electric generators work and derived the generator equation we also talked about transformers and how they use mutual inductance to change voltage finally we described how mutual inductance is used in wireless chargers

blank and braincraft this episode of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'we couldn t keep the lights on without alternating currents we ve talked about how they change voltage which helps transmit electricity over long distances but there s so much more to the physics of ac circuitry for example how are alternating currents affected when you add resistors or capacitors or an inductor these three pieces of the electricity puzzle are used everywhere and today we re going to put them together theme music when you talk about direct current circuits describing the voltage and current in a given situation is pretty straightforward typically the voltage source in a dc circuit is unchanging so the current will be constant too but in an ac circuit both the voltage and the current are constantly changing directions from positive to negative and back again so how do you describe values when they re constantly changing well when a current alternates quickly it s changing back and forth between maximum and minimum values known as peak current and peak here means either maximum or minimum positive or negative since the flow of current has the same magnitude mathematically a current is equal to the peak current times a sine function related to the system s frequency typically hertz and the same is true for the voltage in an ac circuit it changes between a maximum and minimum peak voltage in order to generate the alternating current now let s say you re calculating the average power consumed by an ac circuit you can use the handy power expression for dc circuits which we ve already derived in order to find the consumed energy over time in terms of current and resistance then you can replace the current with our new equation for alternating current then since you want to find the average power just take the average of the power expression the sine squared function always reduces to one half when averaged this leaves you with an average power of peak current squared times resistance divided by two but you can only take this equation for dc circuits so far before you have to start making some serious changes for it to help you figure out ac circuits why because of i the value for the current itself think of driving a car in stop-and-go traffic you speed up at times you slow down at others but if you average it out over the whole trip you ve got an effective speed somewhere in the middle that s what current is like in ac calculations so in order to express current in this equation we need a new variable that represents this effective value and that variable is the root-mean-squared or rms value of current it s really just the value you would get if you squared the current took the average and then square rooted it again hence the name root mean square now this same derivation works for alternating voltage as well with the rms value of voltage being equal to the peak voltage divided by the square root of with these two rms values at your disposal you can then use them in place of current and voltage in dc equations with power equaling the rms current times rms voltage so now that we have rms values to better describe current and voltage in ac circuits let s think about how we can use the unique nature of ac circuits to our advantage for example with coils of wire we know that when the current is changing a magnetic flux is induced in the coil and that flux seeks to oppose the current with an electromotive force or emf in the opposite direction and this is the rule that we know as lenz s law and this relationship works the opposite way as well with a changing magnetic flux inducing an emf that opposes the flux so in an ac circuit what you end up with is a changing current that induces an opposing magnetic flux which in turn induces an emf in the opposite direction of the current this induction of an emf that opposes the main current is called self-inductance and to calculate an induced emf you just take the change in current over time and multiply it by negative l l is a constant known as the inductance signifying how well that specific coil induces an opposing current depending on its shape and size and it s negative because the induced emf is in the opposite direction of the main current inductance by the way is expressed in units called henrys induction of an electromagnetic force is so useful that engineers make coils that are designed to maximize their self-inductance these coils that are designed for self-inductance are called inductors in a circuit diagram they look like small coils cause that s pretty much what they are so to get a handle on how inductors work let s first consider one in a dc circuit let s say this circuit has an inductor connected in series with a battery that has a constant voltage v naught since most inductors have a natural resistance we ll say that there s also a small resistor in series with the inductor and battery and because we have an inductance l and a resistance r we call this configuration an lr circuit if we set up this circuit and then insert the battery the voltage will immediately be v naught but the current won t reach its maximum value that s because the inductor opposes the sudden change in current that was caused by the sudden voltage change so the current will increase gradually until it eventually reaches maximum current which is the battery s voltage divided by the resistance the current in this case is kind of like a car that s accelerating from a dead stop even if you stomp down on the gas pedal you won t immediately start going at top speed you re going to have to build up to it over time so you have to consider time when you re dealing with inductors mathematically the current in a circuit with an inductor is expressed as the maximum current times one minus e to the negative t over tau the maximum current is the voltage divided by the resistance and tau is the time constant equal to the inductance divided by the resistance this time constant has all kinds of mathematical meaning that we can t get into right now but you can see that as time goes to infinity you get closer to the maximum current value put in terms of our car analogy the maximum current is like the fastest that your car will go and the time constant lets you know how long you need to press down on the accelerator to get there a small time constant means less time is needed to reach maximum speed and also less time to slow down to a stop a large time constant means the opposite that a lot of time is necessary to speed up and slow down now let s say the circuit has reached steady-state with the current at that maximum value there s no longer a changing current so the inductor acts just like a piece of wire but if the battery is suddenly removed the current won t drop to immediately because remember the inductor opposes the change in current with its own changing magnetic flux so after the battery is removed the inductor generates its own current this is like driving a car and then taking your foot off the accelerator you ve stopped the car from going faster but you won t stop immediately instead you ll slow down over time before you stop entirely so you can write this as the decreasing version of the earlier current equation with current equaling the maximum possible current times e to the negative t over tau i max is the same and tau is the same and once enough time has passed then the current is equal to so inductors oppose a change in current whether it s an increase or a decrease when you switch a device on or off and you notice a delay that s probably because an inductor is in the system by flipping the switch you ve either started or ended a voltage supply but an inductor in the system delays the current from starting or stopping immediately ok so that s inductors now let s go back to ac circuits and combine an inductor a resistor and a capacitor all in one circuit each component will behave differently when connected to the source of alternating voltage so before we combine everything let s look at each component as if it alone were in series with the source let s start with a resistor when the voltage is at peak voltage the current through the resistor will also be at peak current since the voltage and current peaks occur at the same time the two are said to be in phase for inductors and capacitors however the story s a little different as the alternating voltage is applied across the inductor the opposing emf that s induced equals the amount of voltage that drops across the device the inductor has an insignificant amount of resistance so when it s the only device in the circuit all the voltage must be opposed by the opposing emf in this equation the voltage is at maximum when the current is changing the fastest and the voltage is when the current isn t changing at all this means that when the current is there s peak voltage and when current is at its peak and unchanging the voltage is when you express this graphically it means that the current lags behind voltage by degrees or a quarter cycle so in ac circuit inductors we say that the current and voltage are out-of-phase which means they don t peak at the same time capacitors in ac circuits are also out of phase but for a different reason let s look at a circuit with only an alternating voltage source and a capacitor when the current flows in one direction charge momentarily builds up on one of the plates so when the voltage changes from positive to negative the capacitor acts as a smaller voltage source that still pushes the current along in this case current leads voltage by degrees changing the direction ahead of the voltage source so let s sum up current in inductors lags voltage current in resistors is in phase with voltage and current in capacitors leads voltage another thing that sets inductors and capacitors apart from resistors is that they don t release a lot of heat the only part of an ac circuit that dissipates power as thermal energy is the resistance inductors and capacitors both have negligible resistance and they don t dissipate heat but they do have voltage drops across each component so their voltage drops will still affect how much voltage the circuit can supply to other components that do need to dissipate power so when you have an ac circuit with a resistor inductor and capacitor in series you can calculate the voltage supplied versus the voltage applied across each component by adding all of the component voltage drops together every voltage drop peaks at a different time but the sum will always equal that of the source what goes in must go out this wraps up our last look at electricity but you can t forget everything you ve learned about electromagnetism yet because it s coming back in a shiny new form known as light today we learned about currents and voltages in ac circuits we also learned about inductors and we combined our knowledge of ac circuits with inductors capacitors and resistors in order to analyze how voltage and current interact with an alternating voltage source crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head over to their channel and check out a playlist of the latest

equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'by the th century we were pretty sure there was something was going on between electricity and magnetism first in the early s michael faraday showed us how a changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force or emf resulting in an electric current he also found that electric fields sometimes act like magnetic fields and developed equations to calculate the forces exerted by both in the mid- s scottish physicist james maxwell thought something interesting was going on there too so he decided to assemble a set of equations that held true for all electromagnetic interactions and he did a great job of it compiling a set of equations as critical to physics as newton s laws of motion and while he was coming up with his all-encompassing equations maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves and these are the waves that help you view the world around you talk to friends a thousand miles away and heat up that midnight breakfast burrito you ve been craving so maxwell and his equations are to put it simply enlightening theme music when james maxwell created his dream team of electromagnetic equations he started with the ideas and the mathematics that other physicists had already established but he put them together to create a new complete understanding of electromagnetism maxwell s first equation is a form of gauss s law which states that the electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by that surface a closed surface in this case is just the surface of any shape that completely encloses a charge like a sphere or any other three dimensional shape and electric flux is a measure of the electric field that passes through a given area mathematically this equation says that electric flux is the integral of the electric field over the area of the surface which is equal to the enclosed charge divided by the permittivity of free space i won t blame you if you don t remember but the permittivity of free space is a constant of proportionally we ve used before that relates electric charge to the physical effect of electric fields if the electric field is constant over the surface then the left side of the equation becomes e times a maxwell s second equation is also a form of gauss s law only with magnetic flux instead of electric flux magnetic sources are always dipoles with a north and south pole and magnetic field lines that leave from the north pole and return back to the south when you re looking at how a magnetic field interacts with a surrounding surface you see that the field lines that leave the surface out of the north pole must enter back through the surface to reach the south pole this results in the overall magnetic flux being zero if you compare this with maxwell s first equation you can tell that the format with the integral of the magnetic field over the surface area is the same but here the integral will always equal zero for a closed surface now maxwell s third equation doesn t have anything to do with gauss s law instead it s faraday s law but slightly different than how we ve seen it before this is how we ve seen it before if you remember faraday s law of induction says that a changing magnetic field will induce an electromotive force in a loop of wire maxwell s version is more general simplifying faraday s law to show the value of that induced emf it says that the emf is equal to the line integral of the electric field over a closed loop so with this equation you can see the connection between a changing magnetic flux and an induced electric field the fourth and final equation is one that maxwell made the most tweaks to in order to make it applicable to all electromagnetic phenomena maxwell s first and second equations were so similar one for electric fields and one for magnetic fields that he knew there must be an equation that complemented faraday s law as well after all if a changing magnetic flux produces an electric field why is there not a complementary law saying the reverse why couldn t a changing electric flux result in an induced magnetic field here maxwell started with amp re s law which states that a current through a wire induces a magnetic field around a path surrounding the wire in order to make this equation work for all possible electromagnetic scenarios maxwell needed to consider a situation where a magnetic field is induced but not from the flow of current for example picture a charged capacitor that s connected to wires on both sides as the capacitor discharges current runs through both wires generating a changing magnetic flux just like ampere s law says but a changing magnetic flux is also induced between the two plates when there s no wire connecting the plates however there is a changing electric field and it acts like a wireless current in order to account for the magnetic flux generated by this wireless current maxwell added what s known as the displacement current into amp re s law to complete the equation despite being called the displacement current it isn t really an electric current it s just called that because it fits into the equation just like an actual current does mathematically the displacement current is equal to the change in the capacitor s charge over time and that is equal to the change in electric flux over time multiplied by the permittivity of free space constant with the addition he made to amp re s law maxwell s equations were complete and using his laws today we can see a pattern in the production of electric and magnetic fields if a changing electric field is generated then a magnetic field is induced which results in a changing magnetic field that induces an electric field and the cycle continues these oscillations are electromagnetic waves and they re made up of changing electric and magnetic fields that travel through space maxwell believed that we could reproduce electromagnetic waves in the laboratory and he was right to prove it let s look at an object that can produce electromagnetic waves and transmit them through the air an antenna this antenna is made up of two conductive rods each attached to opposite ends of an ac generator when the antenna is operating the two rods switch between being positively charged and negatively charged as the generator changes voltage and when one rod is positively charged the other is negatively charged and vice versa when electric current travels up into the top of the rod you can use the right hand rule pointing your right thumb in the direction of the current to see that how the magnetic field flows around the antenna the electric fields generated by the antenna itself are easier to track since they ll just go from the positive rod to the negative rod but as the direction of current switches the direction of both the electric and magnetic fields change and as the rods switch their charges the waves generated by the initial charge distribution continue to propagate away from the antenna so if you were standing away from the antenna you would be able to measure an electric field and magnetic field that are both constantly changing now what would that look like to grasp the effect of changing fields in motion let s model an electromagnetic wave as it travels through three-dimensional space first note the direction that the wave is traveling in the x-direction now plot the electric field oscillating back and forth in the y-direction the electric and magnetic fields always act perpendicular to one another so the magnetic field will oscillate in the z-direction note that the electric and magnetic fields both peak at the same time so they re in phase these electromagnetic waves are a type of transverse wave which means both fields electric and magnetic act in directions that are perpendicular to the direction in which the wave is moving and how fast do these waves travel maxwell calculated that the speed of each wave is equal to the electric field s magnitude divided by the magnetic field s magnitude this equation simplifies down to an equation with two constants the permittivity of free space for electric fields epsilon naught and the permittivity of free space for magnetic fields mu naught and this speed works out to times meters per second we write it simply as small c and it s the speed of every electromagnetic wave ever at least in a vacuum you may know it better as the speed of light after all light is an electromagnetic wave every electromagnetic wave carries energy through space and can reflect off some material while passing through others but visible light is just one small part of what s known as the electromagnetic spectrum like waves in the ocean electromagnetic waves can vary in their wavelength amplitude and source the wavelength is the distance between the peaks of a wave and the frequency is how many times a wave peaks in a given second you might remember when we talked about traveling waves that a wave s speed is equal to its frequency times its wavelength and since the speed of light is constant you can easily find the frequency if you know the wavelength and vice versa now in order to calculate the energy carried by any electromagnetic wave you need to know the magnitude of the electric and magnetic fields that compose that wave specifically you use these magnitudes to calculate what s known as the energy density of each field which is the amount of energy stored in a field per unit volume then you can combine the energy density for both fields solving for the total energy per unit volume within the wave overall but since you know that strengths of the electric and magnetic fields are directly related you can substitute the electric field magnitude for the magnetic field magnitude and vice versa this lets you come up with the energy density terms that encapsulate the energy in both fields with fewer variables so here s the calculation of the speed of light that maxwell found and the constants that it simplified down to you can take our energy density equation and substitute the magnetic field magnitude b with the electric field times the square root of the permittivity constants with this simplified energy density equation you can then substitute the electric field magnitude for the speed of light and the magnetic field magnitude these equations give the energy density of an em wave at any point during its propagation one last important measurement of delivering energy is intensity which is the energy transported by a wave per unit time per unit area mathematically the energy delivered is equal to the energy density times the volume of space in which the energy is transported over a period of time you can then replace energy density with one of the simplified equations we used earlier so the volume of space encompassed by the wave is equal to the unit area times the distance traveled and the distance traveled will be the speed of light multiplied by the time period after cancelling out like terms you re left with an equation that tells you how much energy you have per unit area based on the strength of the electric field which you can also replace with the magnetic field magnitude a lot of math i know but the vast knowledge of electromagnetism that we have today and the doors it has opened into the fields of relativity and quantum theory are all based on the theories that maxwell and his predecessors developed albert einstein praised maxwell specifically for his contributions but it was the combined effort of revolutionary minds like maxwell faraday and gauss that we have to thank for our understanding of the interaction between electric and magnetic fields today we learned about maxwell s equations and their unifying power in the field of electromagnetism we discussed electromagnetic waves and how changing electric and magnetic fields propagate through space we investigated the different types of waves on the electromagnetic spectrum as well as how to calculate the amount of energy they can carry crash course

moonlight torchlight and flashlight they all come from different places but they re the all very same thing light it s what makes it possible for us to see the world around us so it s worth a close hard look for instance how does light travel when you flip that switch in the bathroom to brush your teeth how does light move from the light bulb to the mirror and into your eyes and if you re one of many people who wear glasses how do those lenses turn a blurry world into a high-definition experience whether it s glasses microscopes or telescopes it s all about bending light to our will how do we go about this grand task of controlling the very thing that helps us see well let s take a look theme music no matter where light comes from we generally talk about it in the same way and make the same assumptions about how it travels say you re lying on the beach basking in a ray of sunshine one of the first assumptions we make is that the light is traveling from the sun to you in a straight line this way of thinking about light is called the ray model and the core tenant of the model is that light travels in straight-line paths called rays but each individual ray is really just a graphical representation of actual light a light source may be emitting an infinite number of rays but we only draw a few to get the point across now let s say we have a flashlight that s emitting rays of light if we point the flashlight at a reflective surface like a calm pool of water we can trace the rays as lines that leave the flashlight reflect off the water and continue on as a straight line note that the rays on top of the flashlight are now on the bottom and vice versa this makes sense because if you re viewing something in a reflection you see its image reversed another important observation is that rays leave the reflected surface at the same angle at which they struck it so if i point the flashlight at a degree angle an angle that we call the angle of incidence it would leave at a degree angle in the other direction so we d say that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence and the fact that these two angles equal each other is called the law of reflection now the way i described the light hitting the pool of water was oversimplified wasn t it because in reality some of the incident light will reflect off the water s surface while the rest of it will go into the water and an interesting phenomenon happens when light rays change from one medium to another such as going from air into water have you ever looked at a straw sitting in a cup of water and noticed how the submerged part of the straw looks bent of course the straw itself isn t bent but the light is when it passes between the water and the air this phenomenon of light rays changing direction at the interface between media is called refraction when a ray moves from air into water the ray s angle after passing into the water will be less than the incident angle so the straw looks bent because the rays coming from the straw into your eyes don t travel in a straight path they become bent so the bottom of the straw appears to be in a place where it s not the angle of a light ray after it passes from one medium to another is called the angle of refraction and it s related to the angle of incidence by snell s law snell s law says that angles of refraction are determined by the index of refraction for each medium and the angle of incidence the index of refraction for a certain medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum versus the speed in that medium and when a ray enters a medium with an increased index of refraction the angle of refraction decreases in other words the higher the index of refraction the smaller the angle and refraction occurs when light leaves a medium too say you have a flat piece of glass standing on end and a light ray enters the glass at an incident angle of theta one the angle of refraction inside the glass would be less than theta one since the index of refraction of glass is greater but once the ray reaches the interface between the glass and the air on the other side it refracts again and now the angle of refraction is equal to that first incident angle so if you look from the right side of the glass your eyes see an object that appears to be lower than it actually is now when you observe an object through refracted light like this what you re seeing is an image a visually reproduced copy of an object and not all images are the same an image is considered to be a real image if the rays from an object converge at some location such as your eye or on some other surface like film real images can be projected onto screens because the light rays from an object are actually traveling there but the alternative is a virtual image an image where the light rays don t actually converge so your eyes construct an image as if the diverging rays originated from a single point when you look in the mirror for example it looks like you re standing on the other side of the mirror but you aren t you re seeing a virtual image because the light rays that make up your reflection aren t actually converging to form an image of you now what if we take that plate of glass and re-form both sides so they re no longer flat how does that change the law of refraction it doesn t refraction still occurs it s just that the normal line which is the imaginary line that the angles are relative to changes warped pieces of material that form images of objects are lenses and they re the most critical tool in the field of optics say we have a lens that has a spherical face on both sides known as a convex lens as light rays enter the lens they turn slightly towards the axis of the lens the imaginary line that runs through its center perpendicular to its face as they leave the lens and move back through the air the rays are angled slightly more toward that central axis due to the lens s curvature the rays on the very top and bottom of the lens are bent at a larger angle towards the central axis than the rays near the center which stay almost parallel and they all eventually converge at a single point called the focal point think of a magnifying glass if you hold it just right in the sunlight you can concentrate the sun s rays into a single very hot point that works because you ve taken a bunch of incoming parallel rays and placed your target of choice at the focal length of the magnifying glass that s the distance between the lens and its focal point and one measure of a lens is its power which is expressed simply as one over the focal length but a lens that causes light rays to converge in this way is known as a converging lens and when you look through a converging lens you can see real images from objects that are beyond the focal point this is because light rays from those objects actually converge after passing through the lens and remember when rays converge at a point that means a real image has been formed let s show this using a ray diagram which tells us about the position and size of images as seen through a lens let s take a candle that s some distance from the lens which we ll call the object distance we will use the object distance and the focal length of the lens to find the image distance the location where the image forms on the other side of the lens lenses have the same focal length on both sides so we ll label the focal point on the side opposite of the object as f and the point on the same side as the object as f prime now we know that the ray traveling parallel to the axis will pass through the focal point on the other side so let s draw a ray from the top of the candle refracting through the lens and then passing straight through the focal point f since the focal length is the same on both sides we draw a second ray from the top of the candle through the f prime focal point which then refracts through the lens and travels parallel to the axis the third ray travels straight through the center of the lens we draw this line because if we assume a thin lens then we can draw a straight line through the center and disregard the slight offset that would occur due to refraction with these three rays in place we see that they intersect at a single point representing the top of the candle in the newly formed image you might notice that the image is upside down which will always be the case for convex lenses and the image is formed by light rays that actually originated from the object so a real image is formed the distance between the image and the lens is the image distance and is related to the object distance and the focal length by a very important equation this is the thin lens equation which is derived from ray diagram geometry for a single converging lens the focal length and the object distance will always be positive the image distance will be positive if the image is on the opposite side of the light source this equation holds true for converging lenses as well as their opposite diverging lenses diverging lenses have a concave shape and do the opposite of a converging lens causing rays of light to diverge away from the lens s axis when we re looking at an object through a diverging lens our eyes imagine that the diverging rays originate from a location where the rays don t actually begin so the lens generates a virtual image and when we construct a ray diagram for a diverging lens there are a few key differences first of all the focal point f is on the same side as the object and f prime is on the opposite side while a single ray of light still goes through the very center of the lens the other two rays take slightly different paths resulting in a virtual image forming on the same side as the object itself for a diverging lens the thin lens equation is still true but the focal length is now a negative value another important equation that s true for both converging and diverging lenses is the magnification equation magnification is the ratio of the image height to the height of the actual object when the image is upside down like in our converging lens then the height is a negative value and the ratio of the image distance to the object distance is also negative but all of these ideas taken whole give you a good understanding of optics the fundamental rules that explain how we can observe particles too small to see with our eyes as well as objects that are millions of light-years away today we learned about the the ray model of light and the laws of reflection and refraction we learned about how refraction works with converging and diverging lenses finally we built ray diagrams to discover how objects are viewed through different kinds of lenses

amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'here s a question for you if you shine a light on a coin that s hanging in mid-air what do you think its shadow will look like do you think its shadow would have a bright spot of light right in the middle of it because it would it might seem counterintuitive and th-century physicists thought so too when they tried this experiment but that little spot in the middle of the coin s shadow helps prove one of the most important discoveries ever made in physics light is a wave theme music in the th and th centuries most physicists thought that light was a particle because it often behaved like one but over the years some scientists began to think that it might actually be a wave they did experiments to test this idea and slowly evidence started to build we now know that light is both a particle and a wave a strange-sounding concept that we ll explore more later on but the point is light is a wave and we know this because waves behave in very specific and sometimes weird ways one of the most important reasons that light acts the way it does is known as huygens principle christian huygens was a th-century dutch physicist who believed light acted as a wave he came up with a way to predict how a wave will spread out and we still use his method today huygens principle says that you can predict a wave s position in the future by analyzing its current position all you have to do is think of each point on the wave as the source of its own tinier wave see huygens knew that when you multiply the velocity of something by the amount of time it s traveled you can figure out how far it went and he figured that this would also be true for each individual point on a wave let s say you have a wave that s traveling centimeters per second and you want to know what the wave will look like after seconds to use huygens principle you first draw a bunch of little points along a wave then you draw a half-circle around each point in front of the wave with a radius equal to the wave s velocity multiplied by time so centimeters each of those little half-circles is called a wavelet finally you draw a curve that s tangent to each wavelet meaning that it touches each half circle at exactly one point that line shows the location of the wave after two seconds so a two-dimensional wave traveling through empty space will look pretty simple it s basically an expanding circle but things get a little more complicated when a wave hits an obstacle for example let s apply huygens principle to a wave that moves past the edge of a flat object when the wave hits the obstacle part of it gets blocked but the part that isn t blocked keeps moving past the edge and it follows huygens principle forming wavelets the wavelets from the part of the wave near the edge will curve behind the edge and when you draw a line to connect all the wavelets you end up with a line that bends around the edge in the same way when a wave moves through a slit that s roughly the same width as its wavelength it travels past the slit in a circular curve that spreads outward when waves are re-shaped by obstacles that s called diffraction and it s very different from what a stream of particles would do for example if you rolled a bunch of marbles straight through a doorway you d expect them all to hit the far wall directly opposite the doorway they wouldn t hit the wall in places to the right or to the left of the door but when waves diffract they often spread outward behind obstacles diffraction is one of the reasons there s a bright spot in the middle of the shadow when you shine a light on a round object the other reason is interference in our lesson on traveling waves we described what happens when waves run into each other they interfere in one of two ways waves interfere constructively when the crests of both waves end up in the same spot and so do their troughs the waves essentially combine into one wave that has a larger amplitude with higher crests and lower troughs than either of the two waves did before but waves interfere destructively when one wave s crest run into the other wave s trough and vice versa in that case the combined wave has a lower amplitude than either of the waves did before with perfectly destructive interference the waves actually disappear completely they flatten out together diffraction and interference help explain the results of the famous double-slit experiment conducted by english physicist thomas young in young covered a window so that only a very narrow stream of sunlight passed through a slit into the room then he positioned a plate with two more tiny slits cut into it spaced very close together so that the single beam of sunlight passed through them finally he placed a screen behind the slits if light were just a stream of particles you d expect to see two bright lines on the screen behind the two slits but that s not what young saw his screen had many lines on it there was a bright line in the middle then more bright lines above and below it this pattern is called a diffraction pattern and it comes from the diffraction and interference of light waves light waves interfere constructively when they re lined up exactly right for example to form that line on the screen between the two slits the waves from each slit travel exactly the same distance so they line up interfere constructively which increases their amplitude to create a bright spot but in other places on the screen there s a difference between the distances traveled by each wave this is called the path difference so light waves will interfere either constructively or destructively depending on the size of this path difference when the waves are an exact number of wavelengths apart the crests and troughs will line up creating constructive interference and a bright line but when the waves are shifted by exactly half a wavelength or by wavelengths or and so on light rays will interfere destructively by using trigonometry you can calculate the path difference in a slit experiment it s equal to the distance between the center of each slit d multiplied by the sine of the angle between the point on the screen and the straight line between the slits and the screen now since light is a wave it has the same properties as other waves intensity for example is the energy transported by the light per unit area over time essentially intensity is the brightness of the light as with other waves intensity is proportional to the amplitude squared so if you double the amplitude of a wave s peaks it gets four times as bright if you triple the amplitude it gets nine times as bright when light passes through two slits like in the double-slit experiment the line in the center will be the most intense and the farther the lines get from the center the less intense and therefore the less bright they ll be like other waves light also has a frequency and wavelength these determine whether light is visible and if so what its color is light with a higher frequency and therefore a shorter wavelength is on the bluer side of the spectrum light with a lower frequency and longer wavelength is on the redder side of the spectrum white light like from sunlight is actually all of the different colors of light combined when white light passes through the two slits in the experiment they interfere in a way that allows you to see this rainbow of colors in the lines on the screen but the double-slit experiment isn t the only situation where light creates a diffraction pattern diffraction will happen when light passes through a single slit too producing a pattern that looks like a series of lines that get dimmer the farther you get from the center the light will be brightest on the part of the screen that s opposite the middle of the slit that bright line is created by the rays that go straight through the slit perpendicular to the plate they have a path difference of zero but to reach the other points on the screen different rays of light travel different distances depending on their angle going through the slit and again whether the light interferes constructively or destructively depends on how the rays line up for a single slit the path difference is between the light coming from the very top of the slit and the light coming from the very bottom of the slit the path difference is equal to the width of the slit d times the sine of the angle between the point on the screen and a line straight from the slit to the screen if the path difference is one wavelength long then the path difference between the light from the top of the slit and the light from the center of the slit is only half a wavelength the same holds true for the path difference between the light from the center of the slit and the bottom so a total path difference of a full wavelength means that for each light ray coming through the slit at that angle there s a corresponding light ray that s shifted by half a wavelength and remember when waves of light are shifted by half a wavelength that means one wave s crests line up with the other s trough causing destructive interference so for a single slit when the total path difference is equal to a full wavelength you end up with pairs of waves that cancel each other out and make a dark line now constructive interference through a single slit works a little differently when the path difference between the top and bottom of the slit is equal to wavelengths or wavelengths and so on there will be a bright line that s where the rays interfere constructively as with the previous example this also has to do with the path difference between individual rays passing through the single slit say the light is angled so that the total path difference between the top and bottom of the slit is wavelengths the rays passing through the middle third and bottom third of the slit will be half a wavelength apart so they ll cancel each other out but that top third won t cancel with anything instead it will reach the screen creating a bright line so how do diffraction and interference create the phenomenon we see in the shadow of the coin diffraction makes the light waves curve around the coin s edges when these diffracted waves run into each other they interfere the places where the waves interfere destructively become shadows that s what makes those little ripples spreading outward from the circular shadow but the places where the waves interfere constructively become bright spots that s why there s a bright spot right in the middle of the coin s shadow at that point the waves of light that diffracted around the edges of the coin have all traveled the same distance so the crests of different light waves combine and so do the troughs forming one wave with a higher amplitude and a bright spot today you learned about the wave theory of light we talked about huygens principle and described how diffraction and interference lead to the results of the double-slit experiment we also explored the diffraction pattern from a single slit finally we explained the

amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'light is everywhere but it s not as predictable as you might think it s a wave that travels in straight lines yet it also reflects off of surfaces refracts through various materials and generally changes direction all the time we ve learned how to bend light to our will with lenses and mirrors but it s time to take a step back and ask what we can learn from light what can we discover about the universe by taking a closer look at the light that s produced and reflected all around us it s time to use our understanding of the wave nature of light to explain what stars are made of why you see rainbows in an oil stain in the parking lot and how some fancy sunglasses can make a bright day a lot more bearable theme music in order to unlock the secrets that light can reveal to us we need to look again at diffraction remember that s what causes the pattern of lines that appear when you shine a light through a pair of thin slits the bright lines are the result of constructive interference when light waves build on one another while the dark spaces in between are the result of destructive interference exactly how this diffraction pattern looks depends on the spacing of the slits and the light s wavelength so if you know the distance between the slits then you can measure the diffraction lines to get some information about the light source now you can also shine light through many equally spaced slits -- this called a diffraction grating and when you shine a light through one of these gratings the diffraction lines are much more intense and easier to measure plus when there are more slits there s also more opportunity for destructive interference so the dark spots between bright lines are larger as well now if the light source has light of only one wavelength which is one distinct color then all the lines would be the same color and would be evenly spaced but if you have a light source with two wavelengths then you ll get multiple sets of bright lines whose color and locations will depend on the wavelength and if your light source is white light containing all the visible wavelengths then you ll see a little rainbow in the place of every bright line because the grating is separating out each wavelength these patterns are known as spectra and you can study them to learn about the source of the light to do that you need a spectrometer a tool that uses diffraction grating or a prism to separate the wavelengths let s say that you heat up a cloud of hydrogen until it emits light and then you point your spectrometer at the cloud the gas will emit a line spectrum a distinct pattern of lines at certain wavelengths that correspond to the elemental composition of the cloud in this case hydrogen the spectrum would look like this and you d always see this line spectrum from a heated hydrogen cloud or a compound that contains hydrogen line spectra work for heated gases under the right low-pressure conditions but when solid materials or high pressure gaseous objects like the sun get heated up they emit a continuous spectrum of light that covers a very wide range of wavelengths and in that case you can still get information about the light source because the continuous spectrum from a heated object also contains absorption lines characteristic wavelengths of light that have been absorbed by the same elements that emitted them the sun emits a continuous spectrum but some elements in its atmosphere absorb some of the light hydrogen atoms for example absorb light emitted by other masses of heated hydrogen but you don t always need special equipment to see and study continuous spectra have you blown a soapy bubble and noticed the bright rainbow colors on its surface that coloring is also due to interference and the separation of wavelengths an effect known as thin film interference thin films are layers of material whose thickness can be measured in micrometers or even nanometers of the order of a wavelength of visible light for example a layer of oil on top of water could be a thin film imagine such an arrangement of oil and water with a ray of white light coming down from above we know some of the light will reflect off the top of the oil and some will pass through of the light that goes through the oil some of it will reflect off the surface of the water now the light that s reflected off the oil will interfere with the light that s reflected off of the water and whether that interference is constructive or destructive depends on the thickness of the oil and the light s angle of incidence so ultimately you end up with both kinds of interference each kind occurs only for certain wavelengths of light depending on the angle at which it s viewed because as the viewing angle changes so does the path length so different colors undergo a constructive interference at different angles the result is an alternating pattern of colorful reflected light and no reflection at all constructive interference creates a visible colored reflection while destructive allows light to go through the oil to the water this phenomenon happens not just with layers of liquid but also with layers of some transparent solids -- namely glass you can create a similar effect if you have a lens with one flat side and one curved side and you put the curved side on a flat plate of glass as light shines from above and enters the flat side of the lens some rays reflect off the bottom of the curved lens while others pass through into the thin gap of air that sits between the lens and the plate that light then reflects off the bottom plate and returns back through the lens the resulting interference creates a circular rainbow pattern that extends out from the point of contact between the lens and the plate these circles are known as newton s rings and if the light source is monochromatic the rings simply alternate light and dark displaying the alternating constructive and destructive interference now if you look at the very center of newton s rings where the glass plate is in contact with the lens you ll notice a dark spot that s where the reflected wave of light is not constructively interfering with itself instead at this point of contact the reflected ray undergoes a phase shift of degrees essentially skipping forward half of a cycle remember when a wave is in phase with another wave their crests and troughs are amplified meaning that the light is brighter thanks to constructive interference and when a wave is out of phase by degrees it s destructive with the crests and troughs cancelling each other out the resulting destructive interference is seen in the dark spot at the center of the lens when light reflects off of a surface that has a higher index of refraction than the medium it travels through such as light traveling through air and reflecting off of glass the ray undergoes a destructive -degree phase shift but if light reflects off of a surface that has a lower index of refraction than the medium it s passing through there is no phase shift and the wave then constructively interferes with itself now light is a transverse wave meaning that the wave travels in one direction and oscillates back and forth in a direction that s perpendicular to the direction of travel and like all electromagnetic waves what s oscillating in a light wave is its electric field so when a wave strikes an object the effects of the changing electric field are felt in a direction that s perpendicular to the direction in which the wave is moving but a light wave s electric field can not only move vertically that is up and down it can also oscillate horizontally or side to side since that movement is still perpendicular to direction of travel this oscillation is important because you can limit what light passes through a filter depending on which direction its electric field is oscillating in the filtering of light depending on its oscillation-direction is called polarization the light from a light bulb or from the sun has electric fields oscillating in all possible directionsbut you can aim that light through a filter like a vertical slit so that only one kind of polarized light can pass through in the case of a vertical slit it will only let light through that s vertically polarized that is waves whose electric fields are oscillating straight up and down and if a light wave is horizontally polarized then it won t be able to pass through the slit this is basically how polarized sunglasses work unpolarized glasses only use darkened glass to absorb some of the incoming light but polarized glasses have lenses that work as vertical polarizers blocking out all light except those whose electric fields oscillate up and down this is particularly helpful when you re on or near the water when sunlight reflects off of water each reflected ray is partially polarized in the direction that s parallel to the surface it reflected off of so when reflecting off of flat water the reflected ray becomes partially horizontally polarized and since your fancy sunglasses only let in vertically polarized light your eyes are protected from the glare that comes off the water next time we re going to learn about much more complex instruments that we use to manipulate light but today you learned about how to analyze the composition of a light source using diffraction grating and spectroscopy you also observed newton s rings and the patterns that arise from the interaction between light and thin films finally you learned about the oscillation of light waves and how polarization filters certain kinds of light crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head over to their

coursestudio with the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'this episode is supported by prudential cameras they re the reason you can see me right now and they re also why so many precious moments are stashed away safely inside your smart phone and just like everything else these visual marvels are possible because of the laws of physics to capture an image a basic camera has a lens that light passes through and a lens opening behind that which controls how much light enters the camera whatever light passes through when a picture is taken strikes the film or the digital sensor in the back of the camera to be recorded as a photograph but whether or not you re a photographer every day you re dealing with lenses images and keeping objects in focus because even if you ve never even picked up a camera or a smartphone in your life you re probably still using your eyes theme music your eyes function a lot like a camera does adjusting in order to view the world up close and far away the iris controls how much light enters your eye opening up while it s dark and contracting in the presence of bright light the lens in your eye is controlled by muscles that change the focal length in order to focus on objects at varying distances the incoming rays then enter through the cornea and strike the retina at the back of the eye the retina acts as the sensor that captures the image sending it to the brain in the form of electrical signals and the fovea is the very center of the retina about a quarter of a millimeter wide this small area is the source of the sharp central vision that you use while reading or focusing on a single point let s do a little demonstration to see just how good your eyes are at producing a sharp image cover one of your eyes with one hand and with the other hand hold up something with writing on it like your physics textbook or a grocery list now start with the text very close to your eye so it s blurry and slowly move it farther away until it comes into sharp focus found that spot congratulations you ve located your near point the closest distance at which your eye can focus on an object when someone has a near point that s farther than the average which is around centimeters they have hyperopia more commonly known as being farsighted someone who s farsighted can see distant objects just fine but when objects are too close their eyes can t make light rays converge at the retina and instead the image forms beyond the retina this can be corrected by eyeglasses with converging lenses that bring light rays closer together to form a clear image on the back of the retina now if you have the opposite problem and have a hard time focusing on distant objects then you have myopia also known as being nearsighted in this case the eyes make light rays converge too quickly causing the image to form too far in front of the retina so nearsightedness can be corrected by diverging lenses spreading out the light rays so a focused image is formed at the proper distance but lenses can not only correct problems you have with your vision they can also produce images of things that would indecipherable to anyone no matter how good their eyesight is let s start small and take a look through a magnifying glass any simple magnifier consists of a single converging lens which produces a virtual image that enlarges an object and you can use a trusty ray diagram to show how this image forms if you had say a small leaf that you wanted to inspect you d just put the leaf inside the focal point of the magnifier since the leaf is inside the focal point the rays diverge and the lens forms a virtual image that s much larger than the original object and ideally this virtual image forms just past your near point because if it were closer you wouldn t be able to focus on it now you can measure a lens magnifying power by comparing the angles at which light rays enter your eyes every object takes up some amount of your field of vision and mathematically you can express that in terms of how much that object subtends an object is said to subtend a certain angle of your vision based on how close you are to it and how big it is for example if you re looking up at the moon and you cover it with your thumb then your thumb and the moon are both subtending the same angle to your eye which we measure in degrees so if you look at our tiny leaf it may subtend only two degrees of your vision when it s at your near point say centimeters away but when you look at the leaf through the lens the virtual image is larger than the actual object so it subtends six degrees of your vision in order to find the magnifying power of the lens you just divide the angle subtended by the virtual image by the angle subtended by your unaided eye this equation which holds true for all magnifiers tells you that this particular lens has a magnifying power of three so that s how a lens can magnify something that s right in front of you but what about an object that s very far away like very far away in the early th century telescopes were developed in holland that could magnify distant objects by three or four times our friend galileo heard about this and in he built his own telescope that magnified objects thirty times this was a refracting telescope it consisted of an objective lens on the end closest to the object and an eyepiece at the other end which magnified the image produced by the objective lens while galileo used a concave lens for his eyepiece the standard refracting telescope uses a convex converging lens for both the objective lens and the eyepiece here s how it works the objective lens takes incoming light rays from a distant source since the source is so far away the incoming rays are considered parallel the objective lens then converges the light rays to form a real flipped image inside the telescope this image is very small but the eyepiece acts as a magnifier forming a large virtual image for the observer to view note that the real image is positioned just inside the focal point of the eyepiece maximizing the size of the virtual image and the resulting virtual image is still flipped so any objects viewed through the refracting telescope would be upside down but that can be corrected by using a concave lens for an eyepiece like galileo did now if you want to calculate the magnifying power of the telescope just start with the same equation you used for the magnifying lens but with a negative sign because the image is flipped the original subtended angle is the subtended angle of the unaided eye the angle between the center of the objective lens and the height of the real image and the newly subtended angle is the amount that the object subtends when viewed through the eyepiece the angle between your eye and the rays from the eyepiece since the angles here are so small you can just assume that the tangent of an angle is roughly equal to the angle itself and in a ray diagram you can see that the tangent of the first angle theta is the height of the real image over the focal length of the objective lens that s the distance at which parallel light rays converge after passing through a converging lens likewise the tangent of the second angle theta prime is equal to the height of the real image over the focal length of the eyepiece you get maximum magnification when the real image is just barely inside the focal length of the eyepiece in which case all of the rays passing into your eye from the eyepiece are almost parallel using your small-angle approximation you can then replace the angles in the magnification equation with the new expressions in terms of image height and focal lengths after all of the like terms cancel out you re left with a magnification equation in terms of the focal lengths of the objective lens and the eyepiece galileo pioneered the use of refracting telescopes in astronomy but today many other types of telescopes are used for space research many like the hubble space telescope are reflecting telescopes using mirrors as the objective lens so that they can have huge openings taking in as much light as possible in order to best capture images of distant objects these mirrors are convex causing rays to converge into a real image which is then magnified through an eyepiece or projected directly onto a digital sensor now let s switch gears and shrink back down to the small stuff a simple magnifier isn t enough to study objects on the cellular scale so we ve developed compound microscopes which like a telescope use objective lenses and eyepieces to magnify objects only this time the object distance to the objective lens is much smaller the object is placed just beyond the focal point of the objective lens so light rays again form a flipped real image on the other side and just like with telescopes the real image is just inside the focal point of the eyepiece generating a large virtual image for the observer to view now remember for all of these optical instruments our original optics equations still hold true we have the magnification equation expressed in terms of subtended angles but we can still use the equations in terms of distance and height for both objects and images likewise the thin lens equation is still applicable in most of our basic situations remember that it s the equation that relates the object distance and the image distance to the lens s focal length now as amazing as our technology has become for capturing images we can t escape the fundamental wave nature of light when we first learned about how light travels as a wave we saw how light passing through a thin slit spreads beyond the edges of the slit this diffraction which is the reshaping of light by obstacles happens in lenses too since lenses have edges the incoming rays will always diffract and produce slightly blurred images even if the lens is perfectly crafted for instance a single point of light when captured by a camera will appear as a central bright spot known as a diffraction disk with weakening circular rings of light spreading out from it the ability of a camera to produce images of points very close together is called resolution a term that you ve probably heard before the higher the resolution the clearer two points that are close together will appear in an image for telescopes and microscopes the ability to resolve an image becomes more difficult as the magnification gets higher because the diffraction patterns that they create are magnified too so the magnifying power of optical tools is limited because light acts like the wave that it is today we learned about the human eye functions like a camera we also studied simple magnifiers and how to generate an enlarged virtual image then we analyzed how refracting telescopes and compound microscopes function using the same principles finally we discussed how the wave nature of light affects the resolution of images in cameras and all optical instruments thanks to prudential for sponsoring this episode what matters most to you today is it

c kinney crash course studiowith the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'this episode is supported by prudential let s say you re waiting for a friend of yours to arrive on a train and i should point out it s a very-much-hypothetical train for one thing it s moving toward you in a vacuum and somehow it can travel at half the speed of light but your friend bob is on this amazing hypothetical train oh and the front of the train has a headlight from bob s perspective standing on the train the light from the headlight is moving away from him at the speed of light so the train is moving at half the speed of light but at the same time it s shooting out light from its headlight that s moving at the speed of light you d think that from your perspective on the platform it would look like the light coming from the headlight was moving at one and a half times the speed of light because it would have its own speed plus the speed of the train but that s not true because light always has to move at the same speed through a vacuum from any perspective so from your point of view on the platform that light wouldn t look like it s going faster than the speed of light it would just look like it s moving at exactly the speed of light as counterintuitive and strange as that sounds special relativity explains why theme music the theory of special relativity was proposed by albert einstein in it explains the behavior of things that move very very fast as in a significant fraction of the speed of light where regular newtonian physics doesn t always apply it s called special relativity because it only applies to specific situations where the different frames of reference aren t accelerating they re called inertial reference frames in our train example the two reference frames are the perspective of someone standing on the train and someone standing on the platform neither reference frame is accelerating so they re inertial and so special relativity applies now special relativity is built around two main assumptions or postulates the first says that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames it doesn t matter whether you re on the train or on the platform the same equations will apply this has to be true because there s no real way to distinguish between reference frames for all bob knows from his perspective on the train as it passes the platform he s sitting perfectly still while the platform zooms past him or the platform could be staying put while he moves past it the first postulate tells us that it doesn t matter the physics will play out in the same way no matter what the second postulate says that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers about meters per second always whether or not the light source is moving physicists have tested this fact with lots of experiments it s definitely true all the time so even if light is coming from a train that s moving at half the speed of light the lightitself is still moving at about three hundred million meters per second and this is where things start to get weird you already know that speed multiplied by time equals distance but special relativity tells us that when it comes to light speed is always constant which would mean that the other two variables would have to change time and distance and they do when time changes that s called time dilation and when distance changes that s called length contraction time dilation occurs when another reference frame is moving relative to you so time in that reference frame slows down relative to the time you measure you can see why if we go back to bob s train say bob stands on the side of his train car that s closer to the platform and he s facing a mirror on the opposite side of the car meters away he shines a flashlight toward this mirror which reflects the light right back towards him from bob s point of view on the train the situation is very simple the light traveled straight to the mirror and back a distance of meters at the speed of light sure looking through the window you saw the light travel to the mirror and back but meanwhile the train was still moving while the light traveled toward the mirror the mirror moved sideways relative to your spot on the platform and while the light traveled back toward bob bob moved even farther sideways the result is that you saw the light travel diagonally as though its path formed two sides of a triangle from your point of view the light traveled a greater distance than it did from bob s point of view but special relativity tells us that the light s speed was still exactly c even though it traveled a greater distance and if the light traveled a greater distance at the same speed then it must have been traveling for longer you and bob are both timing the exact same series of events but you re measuring a longer time than bob is so from your perspective on the platform time has slowed down for bob that s time dilation if you measured the distance the light was traveling from your perspective on the platform you d calculate that time slowed down for bob by a factor of divided by the square root of minus the train s velocity squared divided by the speed of light squared we call this factor gamma and it applies to any situation where another inertial reference frame is moving relative to yours time in that moving reference frame will seem to equal time in your reference frame multiplied by gamma gamma always has to be greater than because the velocity of the moving reference frame always has to be less than c the speed of light so time is slower in that moving reference frame because time can pass differently for people depending on their frame of reference there s also no universal concept of simultaneity in other words something that seems simultaneous to you might not be simultaneous to bob say you see a flash of lightning at each end of bob s train at the exact same time as he passes you on the platform i mean we re already talking about a train going half the speed of light so let s say it gets struck by lightning too for some reason you see both flashes at the same time and they re both the same distance from you traveling at the same speed so you can conclude that lightning struck both ends of his train at the same time but from bob s perspective on the train that s not what happened because while the light is traveling from each end of the train to his eyes he s moving at the moment that you see both flashes bob has already moved past you so he s seen the flash from the front of the train but only that one then he sees the flash from the lightning that struck the back of the train light always moves at the speed of light though no matter what your reference frame is that s the rule so to bob the lightning must have struck the front of the train before it struck the back of the train even though they seemed simultaneous to you does your brain hurt yet as if time slowing down wasn t weird enough there s also length contraction length contraction means that if something is moving relative to you its length in the direction that it s moving will seem shorter than it would if it wasn t moving so you might have measured the train to be meters long before it left the station if bob measures the train from where he s standing it will be meters long but from your perspective on the platform as it moves past you the train will be shorter let s say you want to measure the train as it moves past the spot where you re standing on the platform the train is moving at half the speed of light that s set from bob s perspective it takes about x - for the train to pass you velocity multiplied by time equals distance so bob calculates that the train must be meters long now you try taking the same measurement problem is we already know that time moves faster for you than for bob while nanoseconds pass for bob only nanoseconds pass for you and if the train takes nanoseconds to pass you while it s moving at half the speed of light it must be meters long in general when something s moving past you its length in the direction of its motion will be equal to the length you d measure if it was standing still divided by gamma length contraction happens for objects moving at regular speeds too but it s so tiny that there s no way you d ever notice it if the train was moving at kilometers per hour it would contract by less than a picometer that s th of the length of a hydrogen atom since length contraction isn t something we see in everyday life it isn t part of our intuitive sense of physics so special relativity tells us that because light always travels at the same speed time dilates and length contracts to compensate space and time they re directly connected to each other that s what people mean when they talk about four-dimensional spacetime if you re describing something physically it s not enough just to talk about its position in three-dimensional space you also need to take time into account a lot of this might seem counterintuitive but that s because we re used to seeing the world at much much slower speeds than light all of which is to say that when you start to analyze things that are moving fast the universe becomes a very strange place today you learned about special relativity we went over its two postulates and their consequences time dilation a lack of universal simultaneity and length contraction we also talked about four-dimensional spacetime thanks to prudential for sponsoring this episode it s human nature to prioritize present needs and what matters most to us today but when planning for your retirement it s best to prioritize tomorrow according

these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'here s a question that s plagued physicists for centuries what exactly is light when we talked about this earlier we came to the conclusion that light is a wave which it is or at least light behaves like a wave when you you use it in certain experiments so for most of the th century it seemed like the question had been settled physicists agreed light is a wave then new discoveries made them start to question that they started getting more and more clues that light could also behave like a particle which led to the strange concept that light was both a particle and a wave this kickstarted the development of a little something you might have heard of called quantum mechanics theme music one of the most important clues that light had to be more than just a wave was what s known as the ultraviolet catastrophe and that name isn t really an exaggeration the ultraviolet catastrophe was disastrous for conventional thinking about the physics of light we ve talked before about how objects radiate heat specifically the amount of heat they radiate over time is proportional to their temperature raised to the fourth power but there s more going on there than just heat objects actually radiate energy that covers a whole range of frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum all different kinds of light now there s this thing called a blackbody which is basically the idealized version of a radiating object no true blackbodies exist but in theory they absorb all incoming light without reflecting any and radiate energy accordingly not all of the energy coming from a blackbody has the same intensity you can predict the intensity of the energy coming from a blackbody or blackbody radiation based on its temperature but when physicists came up with an equation for this intensity using the idea that light is a wave they ran into a big problem the equation they came up with known as the rayleigh-jeans law predicted that the higher the frequency of the radiation and therefore the shorter the wavelength the higher the intensity and that matched up with experimental results really well but only to a point once the frequency of light got into the ultraviolet range or higher the rayleigh-jeans law didn t fit the results of experiments at all instead experiments showed that blackbodies had a peak intensity based on their temperature at a certain frequency the light would be at its most intense and after that the intensity would actually drop as the frequency increased the warmer the object the higher the frequency of the peak intensity but there was always a peak it wasn t supposed to be this way even worse if you summed up the contributions of higher and higher frequencies to calculatethe total power emitted by a blackbody the rayleigh-jeans law predicted that you d find infinite power which contradicts the principle of conservation of energy this was the ultraviolet catastrophe something was clearly wrong with the way physicists were thinking about light as far as they knew intensity was only supposed to keep getting stronger as the frequency got higher so what were they missing the catastrophe was resolved using an equation derived by german physicist max planck an equation that basically led to the entire field of quantum mechanics the equation known as planck s law was actually very simple but the concept it was based on was very new planck s law says that electromagnetic energy takes the form of tiny discrete packets called quanta in other words at a certain point you can t divide energy into anything smaller than these packets and the energy in each quantum is equal to the frequency of the light times a very smallnumber called planck s constant represented by the letter h if you take planck s law into account when you try to predict the intensity of blackbody radiation you end up with an equation that predicts the experimental results perfectly including those weird peak intensities so the ultraviolet catastrophe was resolved but now there was this whole new idea that had physicists rethinking everything energy could only exist in discrete packets quanta before physicists thought energy was a kind of continuous flow but it turned out that at a certain point you couldn t divide up energy into smaller amounts our old friend einstein played a big part in reworking physics using this new information and he won a nobel prize for it in einstein argued that light energy traveled in packets we now call photons which would essentially make light behave like a particle which was weird because remember there had been lots of experiments that showed that light behaved like a wave but einstein suggested a way to prove whether light traveled in these discrete packets an experiment involving the photoelectric effect the photoelectric effect describes what happens when you shine a beam of light on a metal plate electrons leave the plate and hit a nearby collector creating a current einstein realized that by studying the way the electrons left the plate physicists could learn a lot about the properties of light because both the wave theory and the particle theory of light predict that light knocks electrons out of the metal but each theory has a different explanation for why this happens and different predictions when it comes to the details of the experiment wave theory says that when a light wave hits an electron it exerts a force on the electron that ejects it from the metal according to this theory if you increase the intensity of the light you increase the strength of the electric field hitting the electrons so you eject more electrons and these electrons have a higher speed and achieve a higher maximum kinetic energy which is the kinetic energy of the fastest-moving electrons leaving the plate one important thing to note here is that according to wave theory the frequency of the light shouldn t make a difference only the intensity matters particle theory on the other hand says that electrons get ejected from the metal when they re hit by individual photons the photon transfers its energy to the electron which pops out of the metal and the photon is destroyed in the process but there s a minimum energy that the photon needs to transfer in order to get the electron to overcome its attraction to the metal and pop out that minimum energy is called the work function w if the photon has less energy than the work function the electron won t go anywhere but if the photon has more energy than the work function then some of the photon s energy will be used up to tear the electron away from the metal and the rest will give the electron kinetic energy and some electrons will be more strongly attracted to the metal than others but the electrons with the maximum kinetic energy will be the ones that took the bare minimum amount of energy to separate from the metal so according to particle theory we can say that the energy of the photon is equal to the work function w plus the maximum kinetic energy and the energy of the photon is also equal to planck s constant times the frequency this equation tells you that if you increase the frequency of the light the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons should increase accordingly and if you go below a certain frequency f where planck s constant times f would be equal to the work function then you re not going to eject any electrons at all this means that increasing the intensity of the light increases the number of electrons ejected but it doesn t affect their maximum kinetic energy so if you want to know whether the wave theory or the particle theory is right all you have to do is try a few simple tests is there a cutoff frequency below which electrons aren t ejected from the metal no matter how long you wait what happens when you raise the frequency higher and when you increase the intensity of the light does that affect the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons turns out there is a cutoff frequency and the higher the frequency is above the cutoff the higher the maximum kinetic energy is of the electrons and sure enough increasing the intensity of the light only affects the number of electrons ejected it doesn t change their maximum kinetic energy the results of all these tests with the photoelectric effect matchup with the predictions of the particle theory of light so photons really exist light travels in discrete packets and behaves like a particle but what about all those other experiments that showed light behaving like a wave well the thing is light can behave like both in certain circumstances it can behave like a particle in others it can behave like a wave this is called the wave-particle duality when it comes to the physics of the very small your intuitive understanding of the world just doesn t apply you can t describe things like light using the concepts you re used to that work on a larger scale when you re trying to explain something totally outside the way you ve directly experienced the world you re going to run into some brain-bending physics and the discovery of planck s law along with the idea that light energy traveled as discrete packets turned into the foundation for the concepts and equations that we use to analyze the behavior of the very small and that field of physics which studies how quanta behave is what we call quantum mechanics today you learned about the ultraviolet catastrophe and how it was resolved by planck s law we also talked about photons and how the photoelectric effect proves the particle nature of light finally we discussed the wave-particle duality crash course physics is

episode of crash course was filmed in the doctor cheryl c kinney crash course studio with the help of these amazing people and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'one of the strangest ideas ever proposed in physics was that light can be both a particle and a wave and in a french physicist named louis de broglie proposed an even more radical extension of that idea what if the wave-particle duality didn t just apply to light what if it applied to basically everything what if all matter had a wave associated with it turns out he was right applying the wave-particle duality to matter led to the development of a way to analyze the behavior of tiny particles more accurately than ever before and it also helps us understand that there are some things about the physics of the very small that we ll never be able to describe accurately i m talking about uncertainty i m talking about how a thing can be in more than one place at the same time and yes i m talking about a little cat in a box theme music de broglie was a big believer in the idea that there s symmetry in nature his reasoning was that if light could behave like both a particle and a wave then matter should do it too what s more the math seemed to work out light s momentum is equal to the planck constant divided by the light s wavelength so according to de broglie s proposal the same equation would hold true for matter meaning that you could find the wavelength of any bit of matter as long as you knew its momentum the easiest way to test this was by using electrons remember the double slit experiment that was one of the key ways physicists showed that light can behave like a wave when you shoot rays of light through two slits they interfere with each other like waves creating a certain predictable pattern known as a diffraction pattern on a screen placed behind the slits to see if matter could also behave like a wave physicists tried the same experiment but with a beam of electrons instead of light they shot this beam of electrons at a plate with two slits cut into it with a screen behind the plate that glowed wherever it was hit by an electron and they found that the electrons created a diffraction pattern just like light did meaning the electrons were acting like waves and interfering with each other this discovery was a really big deal it showed that de broglie was right electrons do behave like both waves and particles and so does all other matter atoms molecules everything so a ball flying through the air that has a corresponding wavelength when you re driving your car down the highway it has a wavelength even your body can have a wavelength which is just totally counter to the human experience of the universe but that s quantum mechanics for you by now you re probably wondering if all objects can have wavelengths why don t we see them well remember the wavelength is equal to planck s constant divided by the momentum but planck s constant is a tiny number and the larger the momentum the tinier the wavelength for anything that s big enough to see with the naked eye the wavelength is so small that there s no way we d ever be able to detect it take a baseball with a mass of kilograms for example flying through the air at meters per second the ball s wavelength is equal to planck s constant divided by its momentum and its momentum is equal to its mass times its velocity so to find the ball s wavelength you divide planck s constant by the ball s mass times its velocity which comes out to a wavelength of x - meters in other words to write out the fraction of a meter that the wavelength is equal to you d have to write down a decimal point then zeroes then the numbers compare that to the radius of a hydrogen atom which is about x - meters so the ball s wavelength is unimaginably small we have no way to measure waves that tiny so you can t see that your baseball is also a wave but it is a lot of quantum mechanics has to do with the wave properties of matter and probability let s take a look at the double slit experiment with electrons again if you just let the electrons go through the slits slowly it sort of looks like they re landing on the screen in random spots it s only after a while that you start to notice the diffraction pattern because more electrons land in the spots that correspond to the bright bands in the pattern that s because for electrons and matter in general probability is a huge factor in how they behave on the quantum level when quantum mechanics looks at the wave nature of matter it s mostly concerned with the probability that particles like electrons or even entire atoms or molecules will be in certain places at certain times that probability is predicted by the wavefunction an equation that relates some of the properties of a quantum mechanical system like an electron or atom the equation was developed by austrian physicist erwin schr dinger in the s there s a lot of advanced calculus that goes into actually using schr dinger s equation but one of the main reasons the equation is useful is that you can use it to predict the probability of finding a particle at any given point in space known as the probability density function you know those electron clouds you ll sometimes see in models of atoms those show the probability of finding the atom s electrons in the space around the nucleus they re a graphical representation of the probability density function meaning that the shapes of the clouds are calculated using schr dinger s equation one of the most intense debates in quantum mechanics is about what it actually means for a particle to have a probability density function say you have an electron in a box the electron s probability density function tells you that at a given moment there s a certain probability that the electron will be in various locations in the box but if you opened the box to check where the electron is you d see that it s only in one specific spot so what does it mean that there s a probability of the electron being in a bunch of different places here s where quantum mechanics gets weird and counterintuitive again many physicists think that the electron is never in a specific place at least not until you look at it instead in a way it s in all these different places at once but it s still just one electron then once you observe or measure the electron in some way it s only in one place somehow you measuring it forces the electron to be in one spot the idea that a particle can be in more than one state at the same time is an example of quantum superposition and it s the idea that schrodinger was trying to explore in his famous thought experiment with the cat the thought experiment goes like this you have a cat in a box with a device that releases poison only when a radioactive atom decays quantum superposition says that as long as you don t know what state the atom is in and therefore whether the poison has been released the cat is both alive and dead at the same time schrodinger came up with this thought experiment as a way to demonstrate that the idea was ridiculous and it is ridiculous but it s also probably accurate it s just one of those things that s totally counter to the way we experience the world now let s say you do measure an electron there s still going to be some uncertainty in that measurement because of something called the heisenberg uncertainty principle this principle says that no matter how good your measuring instrument is you can only know the position and momentum of a particle like that electron in a box up to a certain level of precision after that you could get a better measurement of your electron s position but you d have a much less precise measure of its momentum likewise you could get a better measurement of the electron s momentum but then you d have to sacrifice some knowledge of its position why it has a lot to do with that whole wave versus particle thing like we said earlier a wave s momentum is just planck s constant divided by its wavelength so if you re using the wavefunction to describe your electron as a wave you can know its exact momentum the problem is that wave is spread out with no exact position so by describing the electron in a way that allows you to measure its momentum you lose the ability to measure its position now you could try describing the electron as a particle and get its position that way but then you d have a similar problem the equations involved wouldn t allow you to measure the electron s momentum so quantum physicists try to make the best of both worlds by describing things like electrons using what s known as a wave packet basically a collection of waves all added together they use schrodinger s equation to calculate different waves that describe a quantum mechanical system like that electron you ve been trying to measure when all those different waves are added together you can get some idea of the electron s position but you also end up with some uncertainty when it comes to the electron s momentum so there s a limit to how precisely you can measure position and momentum combined it turns out that there will always be an uncertainty that s at least equal to planck s constant divided by times pi in a classical world this uncertainty isn t that much of a big deal if you re measuring the width of your desk for example the uncertainty is so tiny that it isn t going to matter when you re trying to measure tiny things like atoms or electrons though it can be a real problem you can t always know an electron s position as precisely as you d like because then you ll have a less precise measurement of its momentum so quantum mechanics tells us that there s a built-in limit to how much we can learn about particles when people say quantum mechanics is weird they aren t kidding the more you learn about quantum the more weirdness you ll find but it s still the best way to describe the behavior of very tiny things today you learned about how the wave-particle duality applies to matter we also talked about schrodinger s equation and the meaning of the probability density function finally we covered the heisenberg uncertainty principle crash course physics is produced in association with pbs digital studios you can head over to their channel to check out a playlist of

and our equally amazing graphics team is thought cafe ', 'e mc you hear it all the time but what does it mean during his study of special relativity albert einstein found that mass and energy are equivalent and that they can be converted back and forth between one another he described that relationship mathematically saying that the energy of a particle is equalto its mass times the speed of light squared this mass-energy equivalence is critical to the study of nuclear physics the studyof the atomic nucleus this is a branch of physics that introduces you to two of the four fundamental forces one in which an element can turn into an entirely different element in just an instant and one that has allowed us to unleash the incredible energy that s contained insideevery atom theme music before we can dive into the wonders of nuclear physics we need to recall a little bit aboutthe thing that makes it all tick the nucleus the nucleus of any atom consists of protons and neutrons the proton is positively charged while the neutron is electrically neutral and bothparticles have nearly the same mass with the exception of hydrogen which only has a single proton in its nucleus everyelement has both protons and neutrons because of this we ll often refer the two particles collectively as nucleons we can describe how many protons and neutrons are in an atom s nucleus using its atomicand mass numbers an atomic number is how many protons are in a nucleus which also determines what elementthe atom consists of the mass number meanwhile is how many protons and neutrons combined make up a nucleus so if there are protons and neutrons in a nucleus then its atomic number would be making it a carbon nucleus and the mass number would be or and if there were protons and neutrons then it would still be a carbon nucleus butwith a mass number of let s put these carbon nuclei in nuclear notation to better show the differences between them first we start with the chemical symbol for the nucleus which is determined by its atomic number then on the bottom left of the chemical symbol we write the atomic number which will bethe same for both carbon nuclei finally we write the mass number on the top left to signify how many protons and neutronsthere are in the nucleus so for our carbon atom with six neutrons we d take the carbon chemical symbol acapital c and write the atomic number in the bottom left and the mass number in the top left for the atom with two extra neutrons the upper left mass number becomes any two nuclei that have the same atomic number but different mass numbers are known as isotopes with most elements having one isotope that is more common than the others for instance of the carbon on earth is carbon- carbon with a mass number of only a tiny fraction of all carbon on earth is carbon- since carbon is most stablewhen the number of protons equals the number of neutrons it s important to know the masses of different nuclei since nuclear interactions are allabout mass-energy conversion to quantify the mass of a nucleus we use the unified atomic mass unit written justas a small u with a single neutral carbon- atom equaling exactly twelve unified atomic mass units this means that one unified atomic mass unit is equal to times - kilograms okay now that we have a notation for describing elements and their isotopes we can talk aboutthe energy associated with a nucleus and its bonds the first thing you should know is that the total mass of a stable nucleus is always lessthan the total mass of the individual protons and neutrons put together for instance the mass of a neutral helium atom is unified atomic mass units but two neutrons and two protons the component parts of a helium atom taken togetherhave a mass of unified atomic mass units that means that the nucleus of a helium atom has unified atomic mass units lessmass than its component parts how can that be well that difference in mass is equal to an amount of energy specifically the totalbinding energy of the nucleus that binding energy is how much energy you would have to add to the helium atom in orderto break it apart its nucleus the amount of energy required to break up a nucleus into its component particles getslarger as the atomic number increases with iron having one of the highest binding energiesper nucleon but while the total binding energy still increases for nuclei larger than iron the binding energyper nucleon in fact decreases this means that very large nuclei are not held together as strongly as small nuclei and since binding energy accounts for the missing mass you can calculate it using youguessed it e equals m c squared now you might be wondering how a nucleus is held together in the first place you ve got neutral neutrons that have no problem getting close to one another butwhat about all the positive protons shouldn t the repulsive electric force keep them apart well one of the four fundamental forces of physics is the strong nuclear force an attractiveforce that acts between protons and neutrons in a nucleus this strong force is substantial enough to overcome the repulsive force between protons but it only acts over very small distances while the electric force acts over longer distances since the strong force only works across such tiny distances larger atoms with high atomicnumbers actually require additional neutrons to overcome the electromagnetic force andmaintain stability within the nuclei those extra neutrons are necessary for atoms with atomic numbers higher than thirty orso as you can see in this chart relating the number of neutrons to the number of protonsin a stable atom and when a nucleus is unstable it can break down into a more stable state this decay of unstable nuclei accompanied by emission of energetic particles is knownas radioactivity natural radioactivity was first discovered by henri becquerel who observed how a chunkof mineral that contained uranium affected a photographic plate that was covered up by paper even though the paper was blocking out visible light the radiation from the uranium penetratedthe paper and left its mark on the plate later scientists studied such decays and categorized the emitted rays or particles into three differentgroups based on their penetrating power first there s alpha decay which is released when an unstable nucleus loses two protonsand two neutrons becoming a different element in the process in alpha decay there s a parent nucleus which is the original unstable nucleus and it decays into a daughter nucleus and an alpha particle which is actually justthe nucleus of a helium atom this decay occurs because the parent nucleus is too large and the strong force is no longersufficient to hold all the nucleons together for example if the parent nucleus is radium it would decay into radon and emit a singlealpha particle the process of the nucleus changing from one element to another is known as transmutation note that the atomic number of radon is just two units less than that of radium and themass number is four less than radium s in alpha decays the sum of the atomic and mass numbers are always equal on either sideof the equation but even though those numbers of nucleons add up remember mass and energy are equivalent so the products of this reaction always have less total mass as measured in unifiedatomic mass units than the parent nucleus has the rest of mass turned into kinetic energy and the kinetic energy released in nuclearreactions is what s used to generate nuclear power but alpha particles have the least penetrating power of the three groups they re barelyable to pass through a piece of paper the second type of decay that can occur is beta decay when an unstable nucleus emitsa beta particle which is just an electron you ll see that whenever an electron is produced so is a neutrino a neutrino is a particle with a very small mass that is electrically neutral its existence is inferred from the conservation of energy for example when a nucleus at rest decays into two fragments it should give each fragmentthe same amount of momentum if the nucleus decayed into the daughter nucleus and an electron the electron would alwayshave the same momentum and the same energy but electrons from beta decay have been found to have energies that vary greatly this suggests that a third particle must be carrying away the rest of energy and experiments have confirmed that these tiny neutral neutrinos are responsible forthat missing energy now a unique part of beta decay is that no nucleons are emitted during the decay process instead one of the neutrons changes into a proton and to compensate for the change in charge the neutron emits an electron and although these electrons come from nuclear decay they re the same kind of electronsthat orbit a standard nucleus once the neutron changes into a proton the nucleus changes from one element to another again an instance of transmutation and beta decay is caused by the fourth fundamental force the weak force while the strong force acts on nucleons the weak force alters quarks the fundamentalparticles that make up both protons and neutrons by converting quarks of one type into another the weak force causes the neutron to turninto a proton as for their penetrating power beta particles are typically stopped by a few millimetersof aluminum the third kind of decay is gamma decay which is what results when a nucleus emits high-poweredphotons in what are known as gamma rays this kind of decay usually occurs when a nucleus is in an excited state which can happen becausethe nucleus is decaying from a larger form or because it collided with a high-energyparticle among other reasons but the point is when a nucleus is excited it wants to transition to a lower-energy state which it can do by releasing a photon unlike alpha and beta decay no transmutation occurs in gamma decay instead the excited nucleus just decays into a ground state nucleus and a gamma ray gamma rays have the highest penetrating power requiring large amount of concrete or leadto stop their propagation and there s so much more we could talk about if we had the time half-lives radiocarbondating the basics of nuclear power just to name a few but e mc squared now at least you know what it means and how such tiny objects asatoms can release such enormous power that s worth minutes of your time right today we learned the very basics of nuclear physics including atomic number mass number and how to use them in nuclear notation we also discussing binding energy and mass-energy equivalence as well as the strong and weaknuclear forces finally we discussed the three major types of radioactive decay alpha beta and gamma

a year of studying the laws of the universe together a year of studying and calculating learning about motion and fluids thermodynamics electricity and magnetism light and sound we find ourselves here space the final frontier we re all voyagers on a mission to understand the universe using the power of physics and even though we ve been doing it for centuries there s so much we have to learn about the cosmos some of the most exciting research in physics today is being done by astrophysicists and cosmologists astrophysicists study the physics of celestial bodies such as planets stars and galaxies their research takes us inside phenomena like black holes and supernovae but we can use physics to try to answer even bigger questions about the universe cosmologists study the universe overall and ask questions about the origin of everything as well as its future it s their job and yours to continue looking into the night sky searching for answers using the tools and knowledge that physics can provide theme music before we can talk about something as big as the universe we need to be able to describe just how big it is when talking about things on earth we typically use measurements in the range of nanometers to kilometers but when we re in space we need something a whole lot bigger for instance i could say that the nearest star to earth besides the sun is x kilometers from us but that s a mouthful for something that s basically right next door in cosmic terms so it s easier to say that this star proxima centauri is light-years from earth a light-year is a unit of length with one light-year equaling the distance that light would travel in a vacuum in one year if you take the speed of light about million meters per second and multiply it by how many seconds are in a year you find that one light-year is approximately meters or million billion meters to give you a sense of scale it takes light just over minutes to travel from the sun to the earth and the milky way is roughly a hundred thousand light-years in diameter sometimes we also use a unit called a parsec which is equal to light years now when we say that proxima centauri is light-years away this also means that when we look at the star through a telescope we re seeing what proxima centauri looked like years ago it takes light that long to get here from proxima centauri so we ll never know what that star or any star or other distant object looks like at this exact moment this means that as we observe celestial objects far away we re looking into the past seeing what stars and galaxies looked like millions if not billions of years ago while we re observing these stars we can use a spectrometer the device that separates wavelengths to reveal the star s absorption spectrum and its elemental composition but when we study very distant bodies we find that their absorption spectrum is slightly different from what we d expect given our knowledge of typical star compositions remember the doppler effect how the pitch of an ambulance siren becomes higher as it approaches you and lower as it moves away the same effect happens with light if an object is moving away from you the speed of light doesn t change but the peaksof the electromagnetic wave that it emits move farther apart this effect which occurs with light emitted by an object moving away from earth iscalled redshift because the longer the wavelengths get the closer they are to the red part of the visible spectrum once astronomers recognized and could measure redshift they found that the spectra from nearly every distant galaxy was redshifted meaning that every galaxy was moving away from us and if that wasn t strange enough astronomers such as edwin hubble noted that the amount of redshift is proportional to the distance from earth so the farthest galaxies are moving away even faster than the close ones georges lema tre a belgian physicist proposed this relationship as hubble s law it expresses the velocity at which a galaxy is speeding away from earth in terms of its distance from us the equation uses a proportionality constant called the hubble parameter which says that for every million light-years of distance from us a galaxy is moving away at an additional kilometers per second now the fact is that nearby galaxies might be going away from us or toward us based on how they re moving within their local cluster but the overall tendency for distant galaxies to recede from us is much more common so hubble s law holds true in most cases and this trend of distant galaxies moving away from us and from one another is called cosmological redshift by the way this expansion looks the same whether you re on earth or not no matter where you are all distant galaxies appear to be moving away from you so this leads physicists to believe that at some point in time all the stars and galaxies were closer to one another a lot closer in the s and s russian-american physicist george gamow developed a theory of the early universe that explained among other things why so many light elements like hydrogen and helium were observed throughout the cosmos he suggested that the universe began in a state of highly compressed hot plasma a sort of hot soup of elementary particles his theory became known somewhat dismissively by his colleagues as the big bang theory and this same theory ultimately predicted that there should be radiation left over from the initial rapid expansion of that compressed plasma this is because hot plasma like the plasma in the flame of a candle is not transparent but ordinary gas like the air around a candle s flame is transparent and it lets light travel freely through it so it would make sense that the early hot universe was originally opaque until it cooled down to the point where it became transparent once that happened the thinking goes light from the big bang was able to travel freely but its wavelength kept stretching out redshifting until it could only be detected as microwave radiation gamow s theory didn t gain much acceptance and it was largely forgotten until in american astronomers arno penzias and robert wilson pointed a radio antenna into space and they discovered cosmic microwave background radiation they basically discovered the radiation from the big bang by accident they found that a low-energy microwave radiation persisted at all times day and night and they concluded that the source of the radiation was the universe itself this cosmic background radiation provides support for the big bang theory and it tells us a lot about the conditions of the early universe thanks to these insights along with the observed expansion of the universe and other evidence we have learned that the universe began in a hot dense state then cooled and produced galaxies and clusters that we see today however many mysteries remain for instance if the universe started with such high density and temperature wouldn t gravity make its expansion slow down the fact is the rate of expansion would slow down only if the universe was filled with nothing but matter and radiation but that s not the case space is filled with a constant or at least slowly varying form of energy known as dark energy and because of the pervasive presence of this energy according to general relativity gravity is actually causing space to expand and accelerate this isn t just theoretical recent evidence suggests that the universe actually is accelerating in its expansion showing no signs of slowing down but beyond the fact that it exists there s not much that we know about dark energy another one of the universe s great mysteries is the existence of mass that we can t see but we know that it too exists when we study a galaxy s rotation we can estimate how much mass is in it by measuring its radius and rotational velocity but when we actually calculate that mass the result is far greater than what s observable as stars and gas the conclusion is that there s an immense amount of mass in the universe known as dark matter which doesn t reflect or emit any light by current estimates dark matter makes up almost percent of all the matter in the universe this means that all visible matter including stars and planets make up just a small percentage of all energy in the universe while the rest is mysterious dark energy and dark matter research in these fields is ongoing and new evidence is found every year refining our understanding of the universe in the past year here on crash course and for thousands of years we have used physics to answer some of life s most important questions whether it s a ball flying through the air or the origin of the universe we can use our knowledge from newton s laws to special relativity in order to move closer to the truth and there s still so much to discover both in the stars and here on earth some of the most groundbreaking research is happening on the smallest scales as physicists seek to understand the building blocks of our universe and the nature of matter itself it s not an easy task and it s why we need scientists and enthusiastic supporters such as yourself to go out be curious ask questions and to find answers through scientific methods today we learned about light-years and how looking in the distance is also looking into the past we discussed redshift and used hubble s law to calculate how much certain parts of the universe are expanding away from us finally we introduced the big bang cosmic background radiation and the mysteries of dark
